[{"resource": {"name": "Trips by Distance", "id": "w96p-f2qv", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "How many people are staying at home? How far are people traveling when they don\u2019t stay home? Which states and counties have more people taking trips? The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) now provides answers to those questions through our new mobility statistics.\n\nThe Trips by Distance data and number of people staying home and not staying home are estimated for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. Data analysis is conducted at the aggregate national, state, and county levels. A weighting procedure expands the sample of millions of mobile devices, so the results are representative of the entire population in a nation, state, or county. To assure confidentiality and support data quality, no data are reported for a county if it has fewer than 50 devices in the sample on any given day.\n\nTrips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. A movement with multiple stays of longer than 10 minutes before returning home is counted as multiple trips.", "attribution": "Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland", "attribution_link": "https://mti.umd.edu/", "contact_email": "mindy.liu@dot.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-06-08T15:22:00.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-19T20:00:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-06-08T15:21:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-06-08T15:22:00.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 124, "page_views_last_month": 340, "page_views_total": 340, "page_views_last_week_log": 6.965784284662088, "page_views_last_month_log": 8.413627929024173, "page_views_total_log": 8.413627929024173}, "columns_name": ["Number of Trips >=500", "Number of Trips 250-500", "Number of Trips 100-250", "Number of Trips 50-100", "Number of Trips 25-50", "Number of Trips 5-10", "Number of Trips 3-5", "Number of Trips", "Population Staying at Home", "County Name", "Date", "Number of Trips 10-25", "Number of Trips 1-3", "Number of Trips <1", "Population Not Staying at Home", "County FIPS", "State Postal Code", "State FIPS", "Level"], "columns_field_name": ["trips_500", "trips_250_500", "trips_100_250", "trips_50_100", "trips_25_50", "trips_5_10", "trips_3_5", "trips", "pop_stay_at_home", "county", "date", "trips_10_25", "trips_1_3", "trips_1", "pop_not_stay_at_home", "county_fips", "state_code", "state_fips", "level"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Calendar date", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of trips by residents greater than 500 miles (trip distance \u2265 500 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 250 miles and shorter than 500 miles (250 \u2264 trip distance < 500 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 100 miles and shorter than 250 miles (100 \u2264 trip distance < 250 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 50 miles and shorter than 100 miles (50 \u2264 trip distance < 100 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 25 miles and shorter than 50 miles (25 \u2264 trip distance < 50 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 5 miles and shorter than 10 miles (5 \u2264 trip distance < 10 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than 3 miles and shorter than 5 miles (3 \u2264 trip distance < 5 miles)", "Number of trips made by residents, i.e., movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home.", "Number of residents staying at home, i.e., persons who make no trips with a trip end more than one mile away from home", "County name", "Date", "Number of trips by residents greater than 10 miles and shorter than 25 miles (10 \u2264 trip distance < 25 miles)", "Number of trips by residents greater than one mile and shorter than 3 miles (1 \u2264 trip distance < 3 miles)", "Number of trips by residents shorter than one mile", "Number of residents not staying at home", "Five-digit FIPS county code", "State postal code", "Two-digit FIPS state code", "Indicates National, State, or County level metrics"], "columns_format": [{"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {"view": "date_ymd"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {"align": "right"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 48, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-02T14:11:52.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Research and Statistics", "domain_tags": ["states", "state", "counties", "county", "covid-19", "distance", "mobility", "travel", "trips", "trip"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Email", "value": "mindy.liu@dot.gov"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Program-Code", "value": "021:053"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Public-Access-Level", "value": "public"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Temporal-Applicability", "value": "2020/P1Y"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Language", "value": "en-US"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Geographic-Coverage", "value": "U.S. counties"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Publisher", "value": "Bureau of Transportation Statistics"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Update-Frequency", "value": "R/P1W"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Bureau-Code", "value": "021:00"}, {"key": "Common-Core_Contact-Name", "value": "Mindy Liu"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bts.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.bts.gov/d/w96p-f2qv", "link": "https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Trips-by-Distance/w96p-f2qv", "owner": {"id": "49zd-krpu", "display_name": "Mindy Liu"}}]
