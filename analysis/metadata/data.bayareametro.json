Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population that can be compared across time and populations. More information about the determinants of life expectancy that may lead to differences in life expectancy between neighborhoods can be found in the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) Health Inequities in the Bay Area report at http://www.barhii.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/barhii_hiba.pdf.  Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and ZIP Codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential ZIP Code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\n\r\nFor the ZIP Code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal ZIP Codes share the same boundaries as ZIP Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between ZIP Codes and ZCTAs can be found at http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. ZIP Code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 ZIP Code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for ZIP Codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest ZIP Code with population. ZIP Code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. ZIP Code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). ACS estimates are adjusted using Decennial Census data for more accurate population estimates. An adjustment factor was calculated using the ratio between the 2010 Decennial Census population estimates and the 2012 ACS 5-Year (with middle year 2010) population estimates.

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission/Iteris: Congested Corridor Analysis\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit ridership refers to the number of passenger boardings on public transportation, which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nThe NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T19:46:08.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T20:56:33.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 154, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 7.276124405274238}, "columns_name": ["Source", "PercentChg_1991", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "Annual_Boardings", "System_Full_Name", "Year", "System"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "percentchg_1991", "est_weekday_boardings", "annual_boardings", "system_full_name", "year", "system"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "Passenger boardings on an average day", "Annual passenger boardings", "Name of transit operator", "", "Name of transit operator"], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}], "download_count": 33, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T20:59:03.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/htq2-hngn", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-by-operator/htq2-hngn", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Greenhouse Gas Emissions - by county", "id": "mvn9-95ub", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions (EN3)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nGreenhouse gas emissions from primary sources\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nAugust 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nGreenhouse gas emissions refer to carbon dioxide and other chemical compounds that contribute to global climate change.

Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents.\r\n\r\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity. Because such data is not disaggregated by utility provider, a simple assumption is made that electricity consumed has the greenhouse gas emissions intensity (on a kilowatt-hour basis) of Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary electricity provider in the Bay Area. For this reason, with the small but growing market share of low- and zero-GHG community choice aggregation (CCA) providers, the greenhouse gas emissions estimate in more recent years may be slightly

which includes buses, rail systems and ferries. The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for total typical weekday boardings.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nThe NTD dataset was lightly cleaned to correct for erroneous zero values - in which null values (unsubmitted data) were incorrectly marked as zeroes. Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:40.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T00:06:10.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:40.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-05-24T00:06:17.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 4, "page_views_total": 145, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 2.321928094887362, "page_views_total_log": 7.189824558880018}, "columns_name": ["Source", "PercentChg_1991", "Est_Weekday_Boardings", "Annual_Boardings", "Year", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "percentchg_1991", "est_weekday_boardings", "annual_boardings", "year", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "Passenger boardings on an average day", "Annual passenger boardings", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}], "download_count": 34, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-05-24T00:07:23.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "economy", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/fibr-7smu", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-by-Bay-Area/fibr-7smu", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Land Use Editor Assignments", "id": "ukte-ksez", "parent_fxf": ["mmt9-jiuj"], "description": "", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "chart", "updatedAt": "2019-03-21T03:16:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-03-19T23:17:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-03-19T23:18:46.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-03-21T03:16:42.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 142, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 7.159871336778389}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-03-19T23:18:46.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ukte-ksez", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Land-Use-Editor-Assignments/ukte-ksez", "owner": {"id": "gmr7-ynpt", "display_name": "Kearey Smith"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Time in Congestion - Corridor (Updated October 2018)", "id": "f57x-8ifw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nTime Spent in Congestion (T7)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nTime Spent in Congestion\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2018\n\nDATA SOURCE\nMTC/Iteris Congestion Analysis\nNo link available\n\nCA Department of Finance Forms E-8 and E-5\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-8/\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/E-5/\n\nCA Employment Division Department: Labor Market Information\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nTime spent in congestion measures the hours drivers are in congestion on freeway facilities based on traffic data. In recent years, data for the Bay Area comes from INRIX, a company that collects real-time traffic information from a variety of sources including mobile phone data and other GPS locator devices. The data provides traffic speed on the region\u2019s highways. Using historical INRIX data (and similar internal datasets for some of the earlier years), MTC calculates an annual time series for vehicle hours spent in congestion in the Bay Area. Time spent in congestion is defined as the average daily hours spent in congestion on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays during peak traffic months on freeway facilities. This indicator focuses on weekdays given that traffic congestion is generally greater on these days; this indicator does not capture traffic congestion on local streets due to data unavailability.\n\nThis congestion indicator emphasizes recurring delay (as opposed to also including non-recurring delay), capturing the extent of delay caused by routine traffic volumes (rather than congestion caused by unusual circumstances). Recurring delay is identified by setting a threshold of consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment from vehicle speeds less than 35 mph. This definition is consistent with longstanding practices by MTC, Caltrans and the U.S. Department of Transportation as speeds less than 35 mph result in significantly less efficient traffic operations. 35 mph is the threshold at which vehicle throughput is greatest; speeds that are either greater than or less than 35 mph result in reduced vehicle throughput. This methodology focuses on the extra travel time experienced based on a differential between the congested speed and 35 mph, rather than the posted speed limit.\n\nTo provide a mathematical example of how the indicator is calculated on a segment basis, when it comes to time spent in congestion, 1,000 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for a 1/4 hour (15 minutes) each, [1,000 vehicles x \u00bc hour congestion per vehicle= 250 hours congestion], is equivalent to 100 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for 2.5 hours each, [100 vehicles x 2.5 hour congestion per vehicle = 250 hours congestion]. In this way, the measure captures the impacts of both slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. \n\nMTC calculates two measures of delay \u2013 congested delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below 35 miles per hour, and total delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below the posted speed limit. To illustrate, if 1,000 vehicles are traveling at 30 miles per hour on a one mile long segment, this would represent 4.76 vehicle hours of congested delay [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 35 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours \u2013 28.57 vehicle hours = 4.76 vehicle hours]. Considering that the posted speed limit on the segment is 60 miles per hour, total delay would be calculated as 16.67 vehicle hours [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 60 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours \u2013 16.67 vehicle hours = 16.67 vehicle hours]. \n\nData sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics.

Note that 2014 data was excluded to data abnormalities for several counties in the region; methodology improvements in 2012 affected estimated by +/- 5% according to CEC estimates. For years 2013 and 2014, a linear trendline assumption was used instead between 2012 and 2015 data points. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated based on the gallons of gasoline and diesel sales, relying upon standardized Energy Information Administration conversion rates for E10 fuel (gasoline with 10% ethanol) and standard diesel. Per-capita greenhouse gas emissions are calculated simply by dividing emissions attributable to fuel sold in that county by the total number of county residents; there may be a slight bias in the data given that a fraction of fuel sold in a given county may be purchased by non-residents.\r\n\r\nFor electricity consumption, the dataset is based on electricity consumption data for the nine Bay Area counties; note that this is different than electricity production as the region imports electricity. Because such data is not disaggregated by utility provider, a simple assumption is made that electricity consumed has the greenhouse gas emissions intensity (on a kilowatt-hour basis) of Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary electricity provider in the Bay Area. For this reason, with the small but growing market share of low- and zero-GHG community choice aggregation (CCA) providers, the greenhouse gas emissions estimate in more recent years may be slightly

Paratransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD.\r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it comes from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area.

In recent years, data for the Bay Area comes from INRIX, a company that collects real-time traffic information from a variety of sources including mobile phone data and other GPS locator devices. The data provides traffic speed on the region\u2019s highways. Using historical INRIX data (and similar internal datasets for some of the earlier years), MTC calculates an annual time series for vehicle hours spent in congestion in the Bay Area. Time spent in congestion is defined as the average daily hours spent in congestion on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays during peak traffic months on freeway facilities. This indicator focuses on weekdays given that traffic congestion is generally greater on these days; this indicator does not capture traffic congestion on local streets due to data unavailability.\n\nThis congestion indicator emphasizes recurring delay (as opposed to also including non-recurring delay), capturing the extent of delay caused by routine traffic volumes (rather than congestion caused by unusual circumstances). Recurring delay is identified by setting a threshold of consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment from vehicle speeds less than 35 mph. This definition is consistent with longstanding practices by MTC, Caltrans and the U.S. Department of Transportation as speeds less than 35 mph result in significantly less efficient traffic operations. 35 mph is the threshold at which vehicle throughput is greatest; speeds that are either greater than or less than 35 mph result in reduced vehicle throughput. This methodology focuses on the extra travel time experienced based on a differential between the congested speed and 35 mph, rather than the posted speed limit.\n\nTo provide a mathematical example of how the indicator is calculated on a segment basis, when it comes to time spent in congestion, 1,000 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for a 1/4 hour (15 minutes) each, [1,000 vehicles x \u00bc hour congestion per vehicle= 250 hours congestion], is equivalent to 100 vehicles traveling on a congested segment for 2.5 hours each, [100 vehicles x 2.5 hour congestion per vehicle = 250 hours congestion]. In this way, the measure captures the impacts of both slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. \n\nMTC calculates two measures of delay \u2013 congested delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below 35 miles per hour, and total delay, or delay that occurs when speeds are below the posted speed limit. To illustrate, if 1,000 vehicles are traveling at 30 miles per hour on a one mile long segment, this would represent 4.76 vehicle hours of congested delay [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 35 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours \u2013 28.57 vehicle hours = 4.76 vehicle hours]. Considering that the posted speed limit on the segment is 60 miles per hour, total delay would be calculated as 16.67 vehicle hours [(1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 30 miles per hour) - (1,000 vehicles x 1 mile / 60 miles per hour) = 33.33 vehicle hours \u2013 16.67 vehicle hours = 16.67 vehicle hours]. \n\nData sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics.

They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents. Metro area boundaries reflects today\u2019s metro area definitions by county for consistency, rather than historical metro area boundaries.\r\n\r\nDue to the limited number of rental properties surveyed, city-level data is unavailable for Atherton, Belvedere, Brisbane, Calistoga, Clayton, Cloverdale, Cotati, Fairfax, Half Moon Bay, Healdsburg, Hillsborough, Los Altos Hills, Monte Sereno, Moranga, Oakley, Orinda, Portola Valley, Rio Vista, Ross, San Anselmo, San Carlos, Saratoga, Sebastopol, Windsor, Woodside, and Yountville.\r\n\r\nInflation-adjusted data are presented to illustrate how rents have grown relative to overall price increases; that said, the use of the Consumer Price Index does create some challenges given the fact that housing represents a major chunk of consumer goods bundle used to calculate CPI. This reflects a methodological tradeoff between precision and accuracy and is a common concern when working with any commodity that is a major component of CPI itself.  Percent change in inflation-adjusted median is calculated with respect to the median price from the fourth quarter or December of the base year.", "attribution": "real Answers", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:05:35.000Z", "createdAt": "2016-11-20T00:25:07.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:05:35.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-01-19T17:35:24.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 94, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 6.569855608330948}, "columns_name": ["Source", "City", "Median_List_Rent_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent", "Median_List_Rent_IA_PercentChg_1994", "Median_List_Rent_IA", "County", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["source", "city", "median_list_rent_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent", "median_list_rent_ia_percentchg_1994", "median_list_rent_ia", "county", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "download_count": 487, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-01-19T17:36:01.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/vpmm-yh3p", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-List-Rents-by-city/vpmm-yh3p", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Miles Traveled in Congestion - Bay Area", "id": "wftq-cs7m", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nMiles Traveled in Congestion (T8)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCongested share of total freeway vehicle miles traveled\n\nLAST UPDATED\nApril 2017\n\nDESCRIPTION\nMiles traveled in congestion reflects the share of miles traveled on regional freeways in congestion for a typical weekday; it is often referred to as the congested share of freeway miles driven also referred to as vehicle miles traveled, or VMT).

Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population. Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and Zip codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential Zip code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\nFor the Zip code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal Zip codes share the same boundaries as Zip Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between Zip codes and ZCTAs can be found at https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. Zip code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 Zip code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for Zip codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest Zip code with population. Zip code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. Zip code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). The ACS provides Zip code population by age in five-year age intervals. Single-year age population estimates were calculated by distributing population within an age interval to single-year ages using the county distribution. Counties were assigned to Zip codes based on majority land-area.\r\n\r\nZip codes in the Bay Area vary in population from over 10,000 residents to less than 20 residents. Traditional life expectancy estimation (like the one used for the regional- and county-level Vital Signs estimates) cannot be used because they are highly inaccurate for small populations and may result in over/underestimation of life expectancy. To avoid inaccurate estimates, Zip codes with populations of less than 5,000 were aggregated with neighboring Zip codes until the merged areas had a population of more than 5,000. In this way, the original 305 Bay Area Zip codes were reduced to 218 Zip", "attribution": "State of California, Department of Health: Death Records", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:05:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-03-22T22:25:30.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:05:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-04-07T01:30:46.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 92, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 6.539158811108032}, "columns_name": ["Year", "County", "Life Expectancy"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "county", "life_expectancy"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "2", "align": "right"}], "download_count": 21, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-04-07T01:30:56.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "public safety"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/g26a-g4jw", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Life-Expectancy-by-county/g26a-g4jw", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Daily Miles Traveled - Bay Area (total)", "id": "prde-snc5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nDaily Miles Traveled (T14)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nTotal vehicle miles traveled\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nJuly 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nDaily miles traveled, commonly referred to as vehicle miles traveled (VMT), reflects the total and per-person number of miles traveled in personal vehicles on a typical weekday.

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission\r\n2017\r\nSea Level Rise Maps\r\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau\r\n1990-2010\r\nDecennial Census\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau\r\n2015\r\nAmerican Community Survey\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \r\n\r\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents.

Data either reflect the annual average or the 98th percentile day (worst-case conditions); some data are reported as three-year rolling averages to minimize noise associated with any given year.

Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T00:10:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:38.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-05-24T00:10:10.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 59, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 5.906890595608519}, "columns_name": ["PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "Source3", "Annual_Boardings", "Source1", "Source2", "Region", "Population", "Year", "PercentChg_1991"], "columns_field_name": ["percapita_annual_boardings", "source3", "annual_boardings", "source1", "source2", "region", "population", "year", "percentchg_1991"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 10, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-05-24T19:38:57.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/kp3f-czru", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-by-Bay-Ar/kp3f-czru", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Transit Cost-Effectiveness \u2013 by Mode", "id": "k6ze-s8kq", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nTransit Cost-Effectiveness (T13)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nNet cost per transit boarding (cost per boarding minus fare per boarding)\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nMay 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit cost-effectiveness refers to both the total and net costs per transit boarding, both of which are adjusted to reflect inflation over time.

Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties.

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission/Metropolitan Transportation Commission ART (Adaption to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project\r\n2017\r\nSea Level Rise Maps\r\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau\r\n1990-2010\r\nDecennial Census\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau\r\n2015\r\nAmerican Community Survey\r\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \r\n\r\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available.

Regional and local geographies rely on data collected by real Answers, a research organization and database publisher specializing in the multifamily housing market. real Answers focuses on collecting longitudinal data for individual rental properties through quarterly surveys. For the Bay Area, their database is comprised of properties with 40 to 3,000+ housing units. Median list prices most likely have an upward bias due to the exclusion of smaller properties. The bias may be most extreme in geographies where large rental properties represent a small portion of the overall rental market. A map of the individual properties surveyed is included in the Local Focus section. \r\n\r\nIndividual properties surveyed provided lower- and upper-bound ranges for the various types of housing available (studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc.). Median lower- and upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the regional and county geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the average of the median lower- and upper-bound prices for the region and counties. Median upper-bound prices are determined across all housing types for the city geographies. The median list price represented in Vital Signs is the median upper-bound price for cities. For simplicity, only the mean list rent is displayed for the individual properties. The metro areas geography rely upon Zillow data, which is the median price for rentals listed through www.zillow.com during the month. Like the real Answers data, Zillow's median list prices most likely have an upward bias since small properties are underrepresented in Zillow's listings. The metro area data for the Bay Area cannot be compared to the regional Bay Area data. Due to afore mentioned data limitations, this data is suitable for analyzing the change in list rents over time but not necessarily comparisons of absolute list rents.

They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

Life expectancy does not reflect how long any given individual is expected to live; rather, it is an artificial measure that captures an aspect of the mortality rates across a population. Vital Signs measures life expectancy at birth (as opposed to cohort life expectancy). A statistical model was used to estimate life expectancy for Bay Area counties and Zip codes based on current life tables which require both age and mortality data. A life table is a table which shows, for each age, the survivorship of a people from a certain population.\r\n\r\nCurrent life tables were created using death records and population estimates by age. The California Department of Public Health provided death records based on the California death certificate information. Records include age at death and residential Zip code. Single-year age population estimates at the regional- and county-level comes from the California Department of Finance population estimates and projections for ages 0-100+. Population estimates for ages 100 and over are aggregated to a single age interval. Using this data, death rates in a population within age groups for a given year are computed to form unabridged life tables (as opposed to abridged life tables). To calculate life expectancy, the probability of dying between the jth and (j+1)st birthday is assumed uniform after age 1. Special consideration is taken to account for infant mortality.\r\nFor the Zip code-level life expectancy calculation, it is assumed that postal Zip codes share the same boundaries as Zip Code Census Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). More information on the relationship between Zip codes and ZCTAs can be found at https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html. Zip code-level data uses three years of mortality data to make robust estimates due to small sample size. Year 2013 Zip code life expectancy estimates reflects death records from 2011 through 2013. 2013 is the last year with available mortality data. Death records for Zip codes with zero population (like those associated with P.O. Boxes) were assigned to the nearest Zip code with population. Zip code population for 2000 estimates comes from the Decennial Census. Zip code population for 2013 estimates are from the American Community Survey (5-Year Average). The ACS provides Zip code population by age in five-year age intervals. Single-year age population estimates were calculated by distributing population within an age interval to single-year ages using the county distribution. Counties were assigned to Zip codes based on majority land-area.\r\n\r\nZip codes in the Bay Area vary in population from over 10,000 residents to less than 20 residents. Traditional life expectancy estimation (like the one used for the regional- and county-level Vital Signs estimates) cannot be used because they are highly inaccurate for small populations and may result in over/underestimation of life expectancy. To avoid inaccurate estimates, Zip codes with populations of less than 5,000 were aggregated with neighboring Zip codes until the merged areas had a population of more than 5,000.

A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE \r\nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission \r\n2017 \r\nSea Level Rise Maps\r\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION \r\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) \r\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \r\n\r\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link": "http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "createdAt": "2017-05-24T20:49:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-07-06T18:04:39.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2017-06-05T22:26:27.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 42, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 5.426264754702098}, "columns_name": ["System_Full_Name", "System", "Source2", "Source1", "PercentChg_1991", "PerCapita_Annual_Boardings", "Annual_Boardings", "Population", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["system_full_name", "system", "source2", "source1", "percentchg_1991", "percapita_annual_boardings", "annual_boardings", "population", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "Percent change from 1991 ridership levels", "Annual transit boardings per-capita (per resident of service area)", "Annual passenger boardings", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "4", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "1", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "false", "precision": "0", "align": "right"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}], "download_count": 19, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2017-06-05T22:28:37.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "economy"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wdpr-f2dr", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Transit-Ridership-per-Capita-by-operat/wdpr-f2dr", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Daily Miles Traveled - by metro area (per-capita)", "id": "2fyg-urrp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nDaily Miles Traveled (T15)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nPer-capita vehicle miles traveled\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nJuly 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nDaily miles traveled, commonly referred to as vehicle miles traveled (VMT), reflects the total and per-person number of miles traveled in personal vehicles on a typical weekday.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.factfinder.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T19:11:19.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:12:26.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-03-24T21:50:19.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 40, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 5.357552004618084}, "columns_name": ["PDA_ID", "PDA", "Year", "Population", "Acres", "PopDensity", "PercentChng_1970", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["pdaid", "pda", "year", "population", "acres", "popdensity", "percentchng_1970", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "text", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "text"], "columns_description": ["Priority Development Area ID", "Priority Development Area name", "", "Population", "Area in acres", "Population density in residents per acre", "Percent change in population since 1970", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precision": "0"}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}, {}], "download_count": 6, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-03-24T21:50:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/whse-7rx6", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-by-PDA/whse-7rx6", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Transit Cost-Effectiveness \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "ib3q-qkdv", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nTransit Cost-Effectiveness (T13)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nNet cost per transit boarding (cost per boarding minus fare per boarding)\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nMay 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nTransit cost-effectiveness refers to both the total and net costs per transit boarding, both of which are adjusted to reflect inflation over time.

INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAll legal boundaries and names for Census geography (metropolitan statistical area, county, city, and tract) are as of January 1, 2010, released beginning November 30, 2010, by the U.S. Census Bureau. A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA.

For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County).

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\t\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\r\n2017\r\nSea Level Rise Maps\r\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/slrdata/\r\n\r\nU.S. Census Bureau\r\n2015\r\nAmerican Community Survey\r\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \r\n\r\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\r\n\r\nSea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise.

city, and tract) are as of January 1, 2010, released beginning November 30, 2010, by the U.S. Census Bureau. A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2018. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a l", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "https://www.factfinder.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:07:46.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T18:59:10.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:07:46.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-03-05T20:43:25.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 2, "page_views_total": 30, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.5849625007211563, "page_views_total_log": 4.954196310386876}, "columns_name": ["Geoid10", "Tract", "County", "Year", "Population", "PercentChng_1970", "PopDensity", "Acres", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["geoid10", "tract", "county", "year", "population", "percentchng_1970", "popdensity", "acres", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "number", "text", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "text"], "columns_description": ["", "Tract ID in numeric form", "", "", "Population", "Percent change in population since 1970", "Population density in residents per acre", "Tract acres", ""], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {"precision": "2"}, {}], "download_count": 4, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-03-05T20:43:26.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/5t76-wu6n", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-by-tract/5t76-wu6n", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Home Prices \u2013 by zip code", "id": "8xer-7dm5", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nHome Prices (EC7)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nHome Prices\n\nLAST UPDATED\nAugust 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nHome prices refer to the cost of purchasing one\u2019s own house or condominium.

The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state.

American Community Survey 1-year data is used for larger geographies \u2013 metropolitan areas and counties \u2013 while smaller geographies rely upon 5-year rolling average data due to their smaller sample sizes. Quintile income for 1970-2000 is imputed from Decennial Census data using methodology from the California Department of Finance (for more information, go to: http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Census_Data_Center_Network/documents/How_to_Recalculate_a_Median.pdf). Bay Area income is the population weighted average of county-level income.\n\nIncome has been inflated using the Consumer Price Index specific to each metro area; however, some metro areas lack metro-specific CPI data back to 1970 and therefore adjusted data is unavailable for some historical data points.

It reflects the number of individuals who are economically struggling due to low household income levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census \nhttp://www.nhgis.org (1980-1990)\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey \nForm C17002 (2006-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines a national poverty level (or household income) that varies by household size, number of children in a household, and age of householder. The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty rates do not include unrelated individuals below 15 years old or people who live in the following: institutionalized group quarters, college dormitories, military barracks, and situations without conventional housing. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). For the national poverty level definitions by year, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year data was used for region, county, and metro areas whereas 5-year rolling average data was used for city and census tract.\n\nTo be consistent across metropolitan areas, the poverty definition for non-Bay Area metros is twice the national poverty level.

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, mode and operator tables for per-capita annual boardings (for an average resident in the given region or service area).\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE\r\nFederal Transit Administration: National Transit Database\r\nhttp://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/data.htm\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\r\nParatransit data is sparse in early years of the NTD dataset, meaning that transit ridership estimates in the early 1990s are likely underestimated. Simple modes were aggregated to combine the various bus modes (e.g. rapid bus, express bus, local bus) into a single mode to avoid incorrect conclusions resulting from mode recoding over the lifespan of NTD. \r\n\r\n2016 data should be considered preliminary, as it is derived from the monthly data tables rather than the longer-term time-series dataset. The unlinked passenger trips recorded in NTD's Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release database is used to calculate 2016 year-over-year change in ridership. The calculated 2016 growth rate is applied to the 2015 annual unlinked passenger trips recorded in the TS2.1 - Service Dta and Operating Expenses Time-Series by Mode to estimate 2016 ridership numbers. 2016 ridership estimates were not made for small operators that did not report monthly ridership numbers. For the Bay Area, this means 2016 ridership estimates are unavailable for Union City Transit (UCT) and Vacaville City Coach. Due to the omission of some small operators from 2016 estimates, regional and metro ridership numbers are likely slightly underestimated. Weekday ridership is calculated by taking the total annual ridership and dividing by 300, an assumption which is consistent with MTC travel modeling procedures; it was also compared to observed weekday boarding data (which is more limited in availability) to ensure consistency on the regional level. Per-capita transit ridership is calculated for the operator's general service area or taxation district; for example, BART includes the three core counties (San Francisco, Alameda, and Contra Costa) as well as northern San Mateo County post-SFO extension and AC Transit includes the cities located within its service area. ACE per-capita transit ridership is calculated using the population of Alameda and San Joaquin counties. For other metro areas, operators were identified by developing a list of all urbanized areas within a current MSA boundary and then using that UZA list to flag relevant operators; this means that all operators (both large and small) were included in the metro comparison data.", "attribution": "Federal Transit Administration: National Transit Database", "attribution_link":

The dataset includes metropolitan area, regional, and county tables. \n\nDATA SOURCE\nAmerican Community Survey County-to-County Migration Flows\n2012-2015\n5-year rolling average\nhttp://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/data/tables.All.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nData for migration comes from the American Community Survey; county-to-county flow datasets experience a longer lag time than other standard datasets available in FactFinder. 5-year rolling average data was used for migration for all geographies, as the Census Bureau does not release 1-year annual data. Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector.

The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty rates do not include unrelated individuals below 15 years old or people who live in the following: institutionalized group quarters, college dormitories, military barracks, and situations without conventional housing. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). For the national poverty level definitions by year, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year data was used for region, county, and metro areas whereas 5-year rolling average data was used for city and census tract.\n\nTo be consistent across metropolitan areas, the poverty definition for non-Bay Area metros is twice the national poverty level.

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro).

It reflects the number of individuals who are economically struggling due to low household income levels.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census \nhttp://www.nhgis.org (1980-1990)\nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey \nForm C17002 (2006-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau defines a national poverty level (or household income) that varies by household size, number of children in a household, and age of householder. The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty rates do not include unrelated individuals below 15 years old or people who live in the following: institutionalized group quarters, college dormitories, military barracks, and situations without conventional housing. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). For the national poverty level definitions by year, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html\nFor an explanation on how the Census Bureau measures poverty, see: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html\n\nFor the American Community Survey datasets, 1-year data was used for region, county, and metro areas whereas 5-year rolling average data was used for city and census tract.\n\nTo be consistent across metropolitan areas, the poverty definition for non-Bay Area metros is twice the national poverty level.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:01.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T17:25:31.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:01.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:04:49.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 3, "page_views_total": 20, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 2.0, "page_views_total_log": 4.392317422778761}, "columns_name": ["Year", "OES_Jobs", "Metro", "Source", "Wage_Category", "Jobs_Share"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "oes_jobs", "metro", "source", "wage_category", "jobs_share"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "Number of jobs in wage category", "Metro Area", "", "Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "Share of jobs in wage category"], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}], "download_count": 5, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:04:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/bt32-8udw", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Metro/bt32-8udw", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Particulate Concentrations \u2013 Bay Area (updated June 2017)", "id": "5yd5-ngmb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\r\nParticulate Concentrations (EN1)\r\n\r\nFULL MEASURE NAME\r\nFine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5)\r\n\r\nLAST UPDATED\r\nJune 2017\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nParticulate matter concentrations refer to the amount of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air we breathe.

The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019.  For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio.  For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA.

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:43.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:32:06.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:43.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:35:13.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 2, "page_views_total": 17, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.5849625007211563, "page_views_total_log": 4.169925001442312}, "columns_name": ["County", "Source2", "Tract", "Source3", "Displacement_Risk", "ID2", "Source1", "LIHH_Total", "Year", "LIHH_At_Risk", "ID"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "source2", "tract", "source3", "displacement_risk", "id2", "source1", "lihh_total", "year", "lihh_at_risk", "id"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "Share of lower income households at risk of displacement", "", "", "Total number of lower-income households", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}], "download_count": 6, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:35:13.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/r2zc-q9se", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-tract/r2zc-q9se", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Migration - metro", "id": "pen9-scke", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nMigration (EQ4)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nMigration flows\n\nLAST UPDATED\nDecember 2018\n\nDESCRIPTION\nMigration refers to the movement of people from one location to another, typically crossing a county or regional boundary.

Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries).

The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty rates do not include unrelated individuals below 15 years old or people who live in the following: institutionalized group quarters, college dormitories, military barracks, and situations without conventional housing. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation. The official poverty definition uses money income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps).

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T17:27:36.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:11:50.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 16, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 4.08746284125034}, "columns_name": ["Change_Jobs_Share_2001", "Source", "Wage_Category", "Year", "Region", "Est_Jobs", "OES_Jobs", "Jobs_Share"], "columns_field_name": ["change_jobs_share_2001", "source", "wage_category", "year", "region", "est_jobs", "oes_jobs", "jobs_share"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Change in the share of jobs by wage category since 2001", "", "Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "", "", "Estimated actual number of jobs in wage category, based on employment data", "Number of Jobs in OES dataset by wage category", "Share of jobs by wage category"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 3, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:03:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/dzb5-6m5a", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Region/dzb5-6m5a", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Targets - Measure Details (updated April 2020)", "id": "2ku3-ersf", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Manage CMS for targets page on Vital Signs", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-08T20:21:09.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-05-03T16:04:46.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-08T20:21:09.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-04-08T19:51:03.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 16, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 4.08746284125034}, "columns_name": ["the_geom", "vs_category", "description", "display_order", "display_target_status", "goal", "id", "measure_definition", "measure_name", "number_format", "progress_direction", "cartodb_id", "vs_indicator_1", "vs_indicator_1_name", "vs_indicator_1_path", "vs_indicator_2", "vs_indicator_2_name", "vs_indicator_2_path", "vs_indicator_3", "vs_indicator_3_name", "vs_indicator_3_path", "y_max", "y_min"], "columns_field_name": ["the_geom", "vs_category", "description", "display_order", "display_target_status", "goal", "id", "measure_definition", "measure_name", "number_format", "progress_direction", "cartodb_id", "vs_indicator_1", "vs_indicator_1_name", "vs_indicator_1_path", "vs_indicator_2", "vs_indicator_2_name", "vs_indicator_2_path", "vs_indicator_3", "vs_indicator_3_name", "vs_indicator_3_path", "y_max", "y_min"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "text", "text", "number", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "number", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "number", "number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 4, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-05-03T16:09:00.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/2ku3-ersf", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Targets-Measure-Details-updated-April-/2ku3-ersf", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Commute Time (by Place of Residence) \u2013 by tract", "id": "kpzd-23cw", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nCommute Time (T3)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCommute time by residential location\n\nLAST UPDATED\nApril 2020\n\nDESCRIPTION\nCommute time refers to the average number of minutes a commuter spends traveling to work on a typical day.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA.

Data is not available at any geography below the county level; note that flows that are relatively small on the county level are often within the margin of error. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin.

The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices.

Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey.

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:27.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:36:40.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:38:16.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 14, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.9068905956085187}, "columns_name": ["Displacement_Risk", "Year", "Source2", "Source3", "County", "Source1", "LIHH_Total", "LIHH_At_Risk"], "columns_field_name": ["displacement_risk", "year", "source2", "source3", "county", "source1", "lihh_total", "lihh_at_risk"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Share of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "", "", "", "", "", "Total number of lower-income households", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement"], "columns_format": [{"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 3, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:38:16.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/a2ix-22kq", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-county/a2ix-22kq", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Commute Mode Choice (by Place of Residence) \u2013 by metro", "id": "k6cx-uzep", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nCommute Mode Choice (T1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCommute mode share by residential location\n\nLAST UPDATED\nApril 2020\n\nDESCRIPTION\nCommute mode choice, also known as commute mode share, refers to the mode of transportation that a commuter uses to travel to work, such as driving alone, biking, carpooling or taking transit.

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE \r\nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission/Metropolitan Transportation Commission ART (Adaption to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project (2017)\r\n2017 \r\nSea Level Rise Maps \r\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION \r\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator) \r\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data. \r\n\r\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available.

The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households.

The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state.

The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, in addition to the primary MSAs for the nine other major metropolitan areas, by aggregating county data based on current metropolitan area boundaries. Data prior to 2011 is not available on Vital Signs due to inconsistent Census formats and a lack of net migration statistics for prior years. Only counties with a non-negligible flow are shown in the data; all other pairs can be assumed to have zero migration.\n\nGiven that the vast majority of migration out of the region was to other counties in California, California counties were bundled into the following regions for simplicity:\nBay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma\nCentral Coast: Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz\nCentral Valley: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Tulare\nLos Angeles + Inland Empire: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura\nSacramento: El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba\nSan Diego: San Diego\nSan Joaquin Valley: San Joaquin, Stanislaus\nRural: all other counties (23)\n\nOne key limitation of the American Community Survey migration data is that it is not able to track emigration (movement of current U.S. residents to other countries). This is despite the fact that it is able to quantify immigration (movement of foreign residents to the U.S.), generally by continent of origin. Thus the Vital Signs analysis focuses primarily on net domestic migration, while still specifically citing in-migration flows from countries abroad based on data availability.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:40:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T01:00:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:40:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T01:04:15.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 11, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.5849625007211565}, "columns_name": ["Inflow", "OD_CaliforniaSubregion", "Outflow", "Year", "OD_State", "Net_Migration", "Region", "Source", "OD_ForeignRegion"], "columns_field_name": ["inflow", "od_californiasubregion", "outflow", "year", "od_state", "net_migration", "region", "source", "od_foreignregion"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number of residents moving from OD geography to Bay Area", "California subregion of origin and destination", "Number of residents moving from Bay Area to OD geography", "Year", "State of origin and destination (CA or All Other States)", "Inflow minus outflow", "Region", "Data source", "Other country of origin and destination (All Other Countries)"], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 1, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T01:04:15.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "health", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/sgrm-yup2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Migration-Bay-Area/sgrm-yup2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Economic Output - by metro area", "id": "q4mi-vigh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nEconomic Output (EC13)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nGross regional product\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nEconomic output is measured by the total and per-capita gross regional product and refers to the value of goods and services generated by workers and companies in a region.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Economic Analysis: Regional Economic Accounts\n2001-2017\nhttp://www.bea.gov/regional/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAs gross regional product data is only available on the MSA level, Bay Area data includes 10 counties (the nine core counties + San Benito County); this results in a slightly higher regional GRP as a result of additional population and business activity.

The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state.

A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a locally-designated area with frequent transit service, where a jurisdiction has decided to concentrate most of its housing and jobs growth for development in the foreseeable future. PDA boundaries are current as of August 2019. For more information on PDA designation see http://gis.abag.ca.gov/website/PDAShowcase/.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area counties and cities are from the California Department of Finance, which are as of January 1st of each year. Population estimates for non-Bay Area regions are from the U.S. Census Bureau. Decennial Census years reflect population as of April 1st of each year whereas population estimates for intercensal estimates are as of July 1st of each year. Population estimates for Bay Area tracts are from the decennial Census (1970 -2010) and the American Community Survey (2008-2012 5-year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average).

Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census.

The median sale price is the price separating the higher half of the sales from the lower half. In other words, 50 percent of home sales are below or above the median value. Zillow defines all homes as single-family residential, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. Single-family residences are detached, which means the home is an individual structure with its own lot. Condominiums are units that you own in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building. Co-operative homes are slightly different from condominiums where the homeowners own shares in the corporation that owns the building, not the actual units themselves. \n\nFor metropolitan area comparison values, the Bay Area metro area\u2019s median home sale price is the population-weighted average of the nine counties\u2019 median home prices. Home sales prices are not reliably available for Houston, because Texas is a non-disclosure state.

For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County).

Multi-family housing includes two to four units and five plus or apartment units.\n\nHousing production data for metropolitan areas for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Population Estimates Program. Housing production data for the region, counties, and cities for each year is the difference of annual housing unit estimates from the California Department of Finance. Department of Finance data uses an annual cycle between January 1 and December 31, whereas U.S. Census Bureau data uses an annual cycle from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.\n\nHousing production data shows how many housing units have been produced over time. Like housing permit statistics, housing production numbers are an indicator of where the region is growing.

Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census.

Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:19:16.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:18:58.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:19:16.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:21:43.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 10, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.4594316186372978}, "columns_name": ["Industry", "Year", "Jobs", "LQ", "PercntChng_1990", "Source", "County", "Quadrant"], "columns_field_name": ["industry", "year", "jobs", "lq", "percntchng_1990", "source", "county", "quadrant"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Location quotient", "Percent change in number of jobs since 1990", "", "", "Quadrant for visualization"], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 5, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:21:43.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/tf93-mdd4", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-by-/tf93-mdd4", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Income (Quintile by Place of Residence) \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "j526-7hm8", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nIncome (EC4)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nHousehold income by place of residence\n\nLAST UPDATED\nMay 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nIncome reflects the median earnings of individuals and households from employment, as well as the income distribution by quintile.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect \u201cannual average employment.\u201d Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\n\nThe following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area:\nNorth Alameda County \u2013 Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\nEast Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton\nSouth Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City\nCentral Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek\nEast Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg\nWest Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo\nMarin \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nNapa \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nSan Francisco \u2013 San Francisco\nNorth San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco\nCentral San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo\nSouth San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside\nNorth Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale\nSan Jose \u2013 San Jose\nSouthwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga\nSouth Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill\nEast Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville\nSouth Solano - Benicia, Vallejo\nNorth Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor\nSouth Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma", "attribution": "Bureau of Labor Statistics", "attribution_link": "http://www.bls.gov/data/", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:20:28.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-05T00:44:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:20:28.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:52:33.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 9, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.3219280948873626}, "columns_name": ["Metro", "Year", "Jobs", "PercentChng_1990", "PercentChng_2000", "PercentChng_2010", "Diff_1990", "Diff_2000", "Diff_2010", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["metro", "year", "jobs", "percentchng_1990", "percentchng_2000", "percentchng_2010", "diff_1990", "diff_2000", "diff_2010", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "number", "text"], "columns_description": ["Metro", "", "Number of workers in a given geography by year", "Percent change in number of workers since 1990", "Percent change in number of workers since 2000", "Percent change in number of workers since 2010", "Change in number of jobs since 1990", "Change in number of jobs since 2000", "Change in number of jobs since 2010", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-05T00:47:56.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/n6rf-8ww2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-metro/n6rf-8ww2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Housing Affordability - Bay Area Overall", "id": "xch7-3urm", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "Housing Affordability (EQ2)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nHousing Affordability\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2018\n\nDATA SOURCE\nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nForm STF3 \u2013 https://nhgis.org (1980-1990)\nForm SF3a \u2013 https://nhgis.org (2000)\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\nForm B25074 (2009-2017)\nForm B25095 (2009-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nImage: Flickr (Creative Commons license), Photographer: Frank Kehren, https://www.flickr.com/photos/fkehren/8481894011\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe share of income brackets used for different Census and ACS forms varied over time. To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above. Historical data for Napa County is unavailable due to an insufficient sample size for renters in a number of years, making it impossible to calculate affordability for all households. All ACS data is for a single year, rather than a rolling average.

While \u201cat risk\u201d households may not necessarily be displaced in the short-term or long-term, neighborhoods identified as being \u201cat risk\u201d signify pressure as reflected by the decline in lower-income households (who are presumed to relocate to other more affordable communities).

Historical data is pulled from U.S. Census datasets and aligned with today\u2019s census tract boundaries using crosswalk tables provided by LTDB. Tract data, as well as regional income data, are calculated using 5-year rolling averages for consistency \u2013 given that tract data is only available on a 5-year basis. Using household tables by income level, the number of households in each tract falling below the median are summed, which involves summing all brackets below the regional median and then summing a fractional share of the bracket that includes the regional median (assuming a simple linear distribution within that bracket).\n\nOnce all tracts in a given county or metro area are synced to today\u2019s boundaries, the analysis identifies census tracts of greater than 500 lower-income people (in the prior year) to filter out low-population areas. For those tracts, any net loss between the prior year and the analysis year results in that tract being flagged as being at risk of displacement, and all lower-income households in that tract are flagged. To calculate the share of households at risk, the number of lower-income households living in flagged tracts are summed and divided by the total number of lower-income households living in the larger geography (county or metro). Minor deviations on a year-to-year basis should be taken in context, given that data on the tract level often fluctuates and has a significant margin of error; changes on the county and regional level are more appropriate to consider on an annual basis instead.", "attribution": "U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link": "http://api.census.gov", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-12-12T22:47:20.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:05:02.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-12-12T22:50:32.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 8, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.1699250014423126}, "columns_name": ["Source3", "Source2", "Year", "LIHH_At_Risk", "LIHH_Total", "Displacement_Risk", "Metro", "Source1"], "columns_field_name": ["source3", "source2", "year", "lihh_at_risk", "lihh_total", "displacement_risk", "metro", "source1"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Number of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "Total number of lower-income households", "Share of lower-income households at risk of displacement", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}], "download_count": 3, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-12-12T22:50:33.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "infrastructure", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wx2e-8w6i", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Displacement-Risk-by-metro/wx2e-8w6i", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs \u2013 by county", "id": "rmxw-ix3y", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs (LU2)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment estimates by place of work\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs refers to the number of employees in a given area by place of work.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides estimates of employment for metropolitan areas outside of the Bay Area. Annual employment data are derived from monthly estimates and thus reflect \u201cannual average employment.\u201d Employment estimates outside of the Bay Area do not include farm employment. For the metropolitan area comparison, farm employment was removed from Bay Area employment totals. Both EDD and BLS data report only wage and salary jobs, not the self-employed.\n\nFor measuring jobs below the county level, Vital Signs assigns collections of incorporated cities and towns to sub-county areas. For example, the cities of East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City and Woodside are considered South San Mateo County. Because Bay Area counties differ in footprint, the number of sub-county city groupings varies from one (San Francisco and San Jose counties) to four (Santa Clara County). Estimates for sub-county areas are the sums of city-level estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2017.\n\nThe following incorporated cities and towns are included in each sub-county area:\nNorth Alameda County \u2013 Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont\nEast Alameda County - Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton\nSouth Alameda County - Fremont, Hayward, Newark, San Leandro, Union City\nCentral Contra Costa County - Clayton, Concord, Danville, Lafayette, Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek\nEast Contra Costa County - Antioch, Brentwood, Oakley, Pittsburg\nWest Contra Costa County - El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, San Pablo\nMarin \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nNapa \u2013 all incorporated cities and towns\nSan Francisco \u2013 San Francisco\nNorth San Mateo - Brisbane, Colma, Daly City, Millbrae, Pacifica, San Bruno, South San Francisco\nCentral San Mateo - Belmont, Burlingame, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, San Carlos, San Mateo\nSouth San Mateo - East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Woodside\nNorth Santa Clara - Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale\nSan Jose \u2013 San Jose\nSouthwest Santa Clara - Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Saratoga\nSouth Santa Clara - Gilroy, Morgan Hill\nEast Solano - Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville\nSouth Solano - Benicia, Vallejo\nNorth Sonoma - Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor\nSouth Sonoma - Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Sonoma", "attribution": "California Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics", "attribution_link": "http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:20:49.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-05T00:31:58.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:20:49.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-17T22:21:00.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 8, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.1699250014423126}, "columns_name": ["County", "Year", "Jobs", "PercentChng_1990", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["county", "year", "jobs", "percentchng_1990", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "number", "number", "number", "text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Number of workers in a given geography by year", "Percent change in number of workers in a given geography since 1990", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}], "download_count": 4, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-05T00:35:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/rmxw-ix3y", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-county/rmxw-ix3y", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Jobs By Industry \u2013 by county", "id": "fwfs-54ce", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nJobs by Industry (EC1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEmployment by place of work by industry sector\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nJobs by industry refers to both the change in employment levels by industry and the proportional mix of jobs by economic sector.

Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:19:46.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:55:55.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:19:46.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:58:46.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 2, "page_views_total": 8, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.5849625007211563, "page_views_total_log": 3.1699250014423126}, "columns_name": ["LH", "Inform", "MLC", "Farm", "Total", "Year", "GeoName", "Manuf", "PBS", "Other", "Govt", "EHS", "FA", "TTU", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["lh", "inform", "mlc", "farm", "total", "year", "geoname", "manuf", "pbs", "other", "govt", "ehs", "fa", "ttu", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Number employed - leisure and hospitality", "Number employed - information", "Number employed - mining, logging, and construction", "Number employed - farm", "Total number employed", "", "", "Number employed - manufacturing", "Number employed - professional and business services", "Number employed - other", "Number employed - government", "Number employed - education and health services", "Number employed - financial services", "Number employed - trade, transportation, and utilities", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 6, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:58:47.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/fwfs-54ce", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-By-Industry-by-county/fwfs-54ce", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Commute Mode Choice (by Place of Residence) \u2013 by city", "id": "cizf-84fb", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nCommute Mode Choice (T1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCommute mode share by residential location\n\nLAST UPDATED\nApril 2020\n\nDESCRIPTION\nCommute mode choice, also known as commute mode share, refers to the mode of transportation that a commuter uses to travel to work, such as driving alone, biking, carpooling or taking transit.

The national poverty level does not vary geographically even though cost of living is different across the United States. For the Bay Area, where cost of living is high and incomes are correspondingly high, an appropriate poverty level is 200% of poverty or twice the national poverty level, consistent with what was used for past equity work at MTC and ABAG. For comparison, however, both the national and 200% poverty levels are presented. \n\nFor Vital Signs, the poverty rate is defined as the number of people (including children) living below twice the poverty level divided by the number of people for whom poverty status is determined. Poverty rates do not include unrelated individuals below 15 years old or people who live in the following: institutionalized group quarters, college dormitories, military barracks, and situations without conventional housing. The household income definitions for poverty change each year to reflect inflation.

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Labor Statistics: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://data.bls.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-07-11T21:15:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:20:18.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 7, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.0}, "columns_name": ["Quadrant", "LQ", "Source", "Jobs", "Year", "PercntChng_1990", "Industry", "Region"], "columns_field_name": ["quadrant", "lq", "source", "jobs", "year", "percntchng_1990", "industry", "region"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Quadrant for visualization", "Location quotient", "", "", "", "Percent change in jobs since 1990", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precision": "4"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}], "download_count": 7, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-07-11T21:18:20.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/ysen-ajs2", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-Location-Quotient-Bay/ysen-ajs2", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs Targets - Measure Performance (updated April 2020)", "id": "wp8y-v93u", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This dataset is used for the Targets page on the Vital Signs website at www.vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/targets.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-08T21:00:55.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-04-07T23:30:42.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-08T21:00:54.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-04-08T21:00:55.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 7, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 3.0}, "columns_name": ["ID", "Measure_Name", "Year", "Value", "Target", "Target_Status", "Target_Description", "Display_Order"], "columns_field_name": ["id", "measure_name", "year", "value", "target", "target_status", "target_description", "display_order"], "columns_datatype": ["text", "text", "number", "number", "number", "text", "text", "number"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-04-07T23:31:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["education"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/wp8y-v93u", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Targets-Measure-Performance-updated-Ap/wp8y-v93u", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Commute Time (by Place of Employment) \u2013 by county", "id": "myjg-apsn", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nCommute Time (T4)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nCommute time by employment location\n\nLAST UPDATED\nApril 2020\n\nDESCRIPTION\nCommute time refers to the average number of minutes a commuter spends traveling to work on a typical day.

To allow for historical comparisons, the Census Bureau merges housing expenditure brackets into three consistent bins (less than 20 percent, 20 percent to 34 percent, and more than 35 percent) that work for all years. The highest income bracket for renters in the ACS data was $100,000 or more, while the homeowner dataset included brackets for $100,000 to $149,999 and $150,000 and above. These brackets were merged together to allow for uniform comparison across tenure. While some studies use 30 percent as the affordability threshold, Vital Signs uses 35 percent as this is the closest break point using the standardized affordability brackets above.

Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income. Housing affordable to above moderate income households are households making above 120% of the area median income.\n\nPermit data is missing for the following cities and years:\nClayton, 1990-2007\nLafayette, 1990-2007\nMoraga, 1990-2007\nOrinda, 1990-2007\nSan Ramon, 1990\n\nBuilding permit data for metropolitan areas for each year is the sum of non-seasonally adjusted monthly estimates from the Building Permit Survey.

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttp://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2014 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP.

Total delay, a companion measure, includes both congested delay and all other delay in which speeds are below the posted speed limit.\nDATA SOURCE\nMetropolitan Transportation Commission: Historical Congestion Analysis\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDelay statistics only include freeway facilities and rely upon INRIX traffic data. They reflect delay on a typical weekday, which is defined as Tuesday through Thursday during peak traffic months. Delay statistics emphasize recurring delay - i.e. consistent delay greater than 15 minutes on a specific freeway segment. Congested delay is defined as congestion occurring with speeds less than 35 mph and is commonly recognized as inefficient delay (meaning that the freeway corridor is operating at speeds low enough to reduce throughput - as opposed to speeds greater than 35 mph which increase throughput). Data sources listed above were used to calculate per-capita and per-worker statistics; national datasets were used for metro comparisons and California datasets were used for the Bay Area. Top congested corridors are ranked by total vehicle hours of delay, meaning that the highlighted corridors reflect a combination of slow speeds and heavy traffic volumes. Historical Bay Area data was estimated by MTC Operations staff using a combination of internal datasets to develop an approximate trend back to 1998. The metropolitan area comparison was performed for the combined primary urbanized areas (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose) as well as nine other major metropolitan areas' core urbanized area. Because the Texas Transportation Institute no longer reports congested freeway delay or total freeway delay (focusing solely on total regional delay), 2011 data was used to estimate 2014 total freeway delay for each metro area by relying upon the freeway-to-regional ratio from 2011. Estimated urbanized area workers were used for this analysis using the 2011 ratios, which accounts for slight differentials between Bay Area data points under the regional historical data and the metro comparison analysis.

This measure reflects the changing industry trends that affect our region\u2019s workers.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department: Current Employment Statistics\n1990-2017\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nThe California Employment Development Department (EDD) provides estimates of employment by place of work and by industry. Industries are classified by their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Vital Signs aggregates employment into 11 industry sectors: Farm, Mining, Logging and Construction, Manufacturing, Trade, Transportation and Utilities, Information, Financial Activities, Professional and Business Services, Educational and Health Services, Leisure and Hospitality, Government, and Other. EDD counts all public-sector jobs under Government, including public transportation, public schools, and public hospitals. The Other category includes service jobs such as auto repair and hair salons and organizations such as churches and social advocacy groups. Employment in the technology sector are classified under three categories: Professional and Business Services, Information, and Manufacturing. The latter category includes electronic and computer manufacturing. For further details of typical firms found in each sector, refer to the 2012 NAICS Manual (http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides industry estimates for non-Bay Area metro areas. Their main industry employment estimates, the Current Employment Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, do not provide annual estimates of farm employment. To be consistent, the metro comparison evaluates nonfarm employment for all metro areas, including the Bay Area. Industry shares are thus slightly different for the Bay Area between the historical trend and metro comparison sections.\n\nThe location quotient (LQ) is used to evaluate level of concentration or clustering of an industry within the Bay Area and within each county of the region. A location quotient greater than 1 means there is a strong concentration for of jobs in an industry sector. For the Bay Area, the LQ is calculated as the share of the region\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the nation\u2019s employment in that same sector. Because BLS does not provide national farm estimates, note that there is no LQ for regional farm employment. For each county, the LQ is calculated as the share of the county\u2019s employment in a particular sector divided by the share of the region\u2019s employment in that same sector.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-08-13T16:14:15.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-08-10T01:11:37.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-08-13T16:14:15.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-08-10T01:14:56.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 6, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 2.807354922057604}, "columns_name": ["Employment", "Industry", "Metro", "Year", "Source"], "columns_field_name": ["employment", "industry", "metro", "year", "source"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Total number of jobs in industry", "", "", "", ""], "columns_format": [{"precision": "0"}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "download_count": 3, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-08-10T01:14:01.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "infrastructure", "demographics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/8hwf-eg5x", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Industry-by-metro/8hwf-eg5x", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Economic Output Per Capita \u2013 by Subregion", "id": "aw7j-kxbr", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nEconomic Output (EC14)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nPer-capita gross regional product\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nEconomic output is measured by the total and per-capita gross regional product and refers to the value of goods and services generated by workers and companies in a region.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nBureau of Economic Analysis: Regional Economic Accounts\n2001-2017\nhttp://www.bea.gov/regional/\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates\n2001-2009\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/\nNote: Table E-8\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates\n2010-2017\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/\nNote: Table E-5\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAs gross regional product data is only available on the MSA level, Bay Area data includes 10 counties (the nine core counties + San Benito County); this results in a slightly higher regional GRP as a result of additional population and business activity.

Given that there are varying forecasts for the heightened high tides (i.e., mean highest high water mark), projected sea level impacts are presented for six scenarios ranging from a one foot rise to six feet. A neighborhood is considered vulnerable to sea level rise when at least 10 percent of its land area is forecasted to be inundated by peak high tides in the coming years. The dataset includes at-risk population and population share data for the region, counties, and neighborhoods.\nDATA SOURCE\nSan Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission/Metropolitan Transportation Commission ART (Adaption to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise Analysis and Mapping Project (2017)\n2017\nSea Level Rise Maps\nhttp://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@mtc.ca.gov\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nProjected areas of inundation were developed by BCDC and NOAA at one-foot intervals ranging from one foot to four feet of sea level rise. Regional and local sea level rise analysis is based on data from BCDC\u2019s ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) Bay Area Sea Level Rise and Mapping Project. This data reflects the most up-to-date and detailed sea level rise mapping for the Bay Area. Sea level rise analysis for metro areas is based on national sea level rise mapping from NOAA, which is best for metro-to-metro comparison. To determine the impacts on historical and current populations, inundation areas were overlaid on a U.S. Census shapefile of 2010 Census tracts using Census Bureau population data.\nBecause census tracts can extend beyond the coastline, the baseline scenario of zero feet was used to determine existing sea level coverage of census tracts. Sea level rise refers to the change from this level. The area of the tract was determined by measuring the component of the tract area not currently under water. This area, rather than the total tract area, was used as the denominator to determine the percentage of the census tract that is inundated under future sea level rise projection scenarios. When at least 10 percent of tract land area is inundated with a given sea level, its residents are considered to be affected by sea level rise.\nFor the purpose of this analysis, SLR scenarios were assumed not to reflect periodic inundation due to extreme weather events, which may lead to an even greater share of residents affected on a less frequent basis. Prior to the impacts from sea level rise, neighborhoods will experience temporary flooding from extreme weather events which can create significant damage to homes and neighborhoods. It should be noted that by directly reviewing maps and tools through the ART (Adapting to Rising Tides) program, regular inundation sea level rise and temporary flooding from extreme weather events are both available. More information on this approach is available here: http://www.adaptingtorisingtides.org/project/regional-sea-level-rise-mapping-and-shoreline-analysis/\nSea level rise analysis for metro areas reflects local, as opposed to global, sea level rise. Recent data has shown sea level is rising faster in the southeast region of the United States. Regional differences in the rate of sea level rise.

Data from 2014 to 2017 comes from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) \u2013 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) Housing Permits Database.\n\nSingle-family housing units include detached, semi-detached, row house and town house units. Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units. County data is available from 1967 whereas city data is available from 1990. City data is only available for incorporated cities and towns. All permits in unincorporated cities and towns are included under their respective county\u2019s unincorporated total. Permit data is not available for years when the city or town was not incorporated.\n\nAffordable housing is the total number of permitted units affordable to low and very low income households. Housing affordable to very low income households are households making below 50% of the area median income. Housing affordable to low income households are households making between 50% and 80% of the area median income. Housing affordable to moderate income households are households making below 80% and 120% of the area median income.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, low-wage occupations have a median hourly wage of less than 80% of the regional median wage; median wages for middle-wage occupations range from 80% to 120% of the regional median wage, and high-wage occupations have a median hourly wage above 120% of the regional median wage.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nCalifornia Employment Development Department OES\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/oes-employment-and-wages.html\n\nAmerican Community Survey\n(2001-2017)\nhttp://api.census.gov\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nJobs are determined to be low-, middle-, or high-wage based on the median hourly wage of their occupational classification in the most recent year. Low-wage jobs are those that pay below 80% of the regional median wage. Middle-wage jobs are those that pay between 80% and 120% of the regional median wage. High-wage jobs are those that pay above 120% of the regional median wage. Regional median hourly wages are estimated from the American Community Survey and are published on the Vital Signs Income indicator page. For the national context analysis, occupation wage classifications are unique to each metro area. A low-wage job in New York, for instance, may be a middle-wage job in Miami. For the Bay Area in 2017, the median hourly wage for low-wage occupations was less than $20.86 per hour. For middle-wage jobs, the median ranged from $20.86 to $31.30 per hour; and for high-wage jobs, the median wage was above $31.30 per hour.\n\nOccupational employment and wage information comes from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program. Regional and subregional data is published by the California Employment Development Department. Metro data is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The OES program collects data on wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments to produce employment and wage estimates for some 800 occupations. Data from non-incorporated self-employed persons are not collected, and are not included in these estimates. Wage estimates represent a three-year rolling average.\n\nDue to changes in reporting during the analysis period, subregion data from the EDD OES have been aggregated to produce geographies that can be compared over time. West Bay is San Mateo, San Francisco, and Marin counties. North Bay is Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. East Bay is Alameda and Contra Costa counties. South Bay is Santa Clara County from 2001-2004 and Santa Clara and San Benito counties from 2005-2017.\n\nDue to changes in occupation classifications during the analysis period, all occupations have been reassigned to 2010 SOC codes. For pre-2009 reporting years, all employment in occupations that were split into two or more 2010 SOC occupations are assigned to the first 2010 SOC occupation listed in the crosswalk table provided by the Census Bureau. This method assumes these occupations always fall in the same wage category, and sensitivity analysis of this reassignment method shows this is true in most cases.\n\nIn order to use OES data for time series analysis, several steps were taken to handle missing wage or employment data. For some occupations, such as airline pilots and flight attendants, no wage information was provided and these were removed from the analysis. Other occupations did not record a median hourly wage (mostly due to irregular work hours) but did record an annual average wage. Nearly all these occupations were in education (i.e. teachers). In this case, a 2080 hour-work year was assumed and [annual average wage/2080] was used as a proxy for median income. Most of these occupations were classified as high-wage, thus dispelling c", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-01-18T18:05:32.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:41:25.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-01-18T18:06:49.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 5, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 2.584962500721156}, "columns_name": ["Wage_Category", "Jobs_Share", "Source", "Subregion", "OES_Jobs", "Year"], "columns_field_name": ["wage_category", "jobs_share", "source", "subregion", "oes_jobs", "year"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number"], "columns_description": ["Wage categorization (low, middle, high)", "Share of jobs by wage category", "", "", "Number of jobs by wage category", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"precisionStyle": "percentage", "percentScale": "1"}, {}, {}, {}, {"noCommas": "true"}], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-01-18T18:06:50.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["economy", "demographics", "health"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/yc3r-a4rh", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Jobs-by-Wage-Level-Subregion/yc3r-a4rh", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Airport Activity (Passengers) \u2013 Bay Area", "id": "pqs3-q8wf", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nAirport Activity (EC17)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nEnplanements or tonnage at airports\n\nLAST UPDATED\nAugust 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nAirport activity refers to the number of passenger boardings at Bay Area commercial airports and to the quantity of goods \u2013 measured in tons \u2013 that arrive in the region as air cargo.\t\nDATA SOURCE\nFederal Aviation Administration: Passenger Boarding (Enplanement) and All-Cargo Data for U.S. Airports\n2001-2017\nhttp://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/\nNote: Passenger only\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nDepending on airport size, the enplanement (or boarding) data for passengers comes from either the Primary or Commercial Airport data tables produced annually by FAA, as some smaller airports shift between these designations over time.", "attribution": "Federal Aviation Administration", "attribution_link": "https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-25T20:08:04.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-08-19T23:02:08.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-25T20:08:04.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-08-19T23:03:25.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 1, "page_views_total": 5, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.0, "page_views_total_log": 2.584962500721156}, "columns_name": ["Year", "Source", "Enplanements", "Airport"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "source", "enplanements", "airport"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "Number of annual passenger boardings", ""], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-08-19T23:03:26.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/pqs3-q8wf", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Airport-Activity-Passengers-Bay-Area/pqs3-q8wf", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Housing Permits - by city", "id": "3eqc-zfpp", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nHousing Permits (LU3)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nPermitted housing units\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nHousing growth is measured in terms of the number of units that local jurisdictions permit throughout a given year.

Row houses and town houses are included as single-family units when each unit is separated from the adjacent unit by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Condominiums are included as single-family units when they are of zero-lot-line or zero-property-line construction; when units are separated by an air space; or, when units are separated by an unbroken ground-to-roof party or fire wall. Multi-family housing includes duplexes, three-to-four-unit structures and apartment-type structures with five units or more. Multi-family also includes condominium units in structures of more than one living unit that do not meet the single-family housing definition. In the permits data from 2014 to 2017, single-family units include all units not strictly classified as multi-family. This may include secondary units.\n\nEach multi-family unit is counted separately even though they may be in the same building. Total units is the sum of single-family and multi-family units.

The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures, with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres.\n\nDATA SOURCE\nDepartment of Conservation: Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program\nGIS Data Tables/Layers (1990-2016)\nhttps://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2010)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey (5-year)\nPopulation by Census Block Group (2000-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nFor regional and local data, FMMP maps the extent of \u201curban and built-up\u201d lands, which generally reflect the developed urban footprint of the region. The footprint is defined as land occupied by structures with building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres. Uses include residential, industrial, commercial, construction, institutional, public administration, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.\n\nTo determine the amount of greenfield development (in acres) occurring in a given two-year period, the differences in urban footprint are computed on a county-level. FMMP makes slight refinements to urban boundaries over time, so changes in urban footprint +/- 100 acres are not regionally significant. The GIS shapefile represents the 2014 urban footprint and thus does not show previously urbanized land outside of the footprint (i.e. Hamilton Air Force Base).\n\nFor metro comparisons, a different methodology had to be used to avoid the geospatial limitations associated with FMMP. U.S. Census population by census block group was gathered for each metro area for 2000, 2010, and 2015. Population data for years 2000 and 2010 come from the Decennial Census while data for 2015 comes from the 2015 5-year American Community Survey. The block group was considered urbanized if its average/gross density was greater than 1 housing unit per acre (a slightly higher threshold than FMMP uses for its definition). Because a block group cannot be flagged as partially urbanized, and non-residential uses are not fully captured, the urban footprint of the region calculated with this methodology is smaller than in FMMP. The metro data should be primarily used for looking at comparative growth rate in greenfield development rather than the acreage totals themselves.", "attribution": "Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program", "attribution_link": "https://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-04-13T23:23:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-11-15T21:50:18.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-04-13T23:23:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-11-15T21:54:06.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 3, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 2.0}, "columns_name": ["acres", "year", "the_geom"], "columns_field_name": ["acres", "year", "the_geom"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "MultiPolygon"], "columns_description": ["Difference in urbanized acres over previous two years", "", ""], "columns_format": [{}, {"noCommas": "true"}, {}], "download_count": 1, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-11-15T21:54:06.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment", "infrastructure"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/j9ka-htng", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Greenfield-Development-Bay-Area-shapef/j9ka-htng", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Population \u2013 by region shares (updated)", "id": "7m6i-as8d", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nPopulation (LU1)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nPopulation estimates\n\nLAST UPDATED\nOctober 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nPopulation is a measurement of the number of residents that live in a given geographical area, be it a neighborhood, city, county or region.\n\nDATA SOURCES\nU.S Census Bureau: Decennial Census\nNo link available (1960-1990)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov (2000-2010)\n\nCalifornia Department of Finance: Population and Housing Estimates\nTable E-6: County Population Estimates (1961-1969)\nTable E-4: Population Estimates for Counties and State (1971-1989)\nTable E-8: Historical Population and Housing Estimates (2001-2018)\nTable E-5: Population and Housing Estimates (2011-2019)\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Decennial Census - via Longitudinal Tract Database\nSpatial Structures in the Social Sciences, Brown University\nPopulation Estimates (1970 - 2010)\nhttp://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/index.htm\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: American Community Survey\n5-Year Population Estimates (2011-2017)\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov\n\nU.S. Census Bureau: Intercensal Estimates\nEstimates of the Intercensal Population of Counties (1970-1979)\nIntercensal Estimates of the Resident Population (1980-1989)\nPopulation Estimates (1990-1999)\nAnnual Estimates of the Population (2000-2009)\nAnnual Estimates of the Population (2010-2017)\nNo link available (1970-1989)\nhttp://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/1990s/tables/MA-99-03b.txt\nhttp://www.census.gov/popest/data/historical/2000s/vintage_2009/metro.html\nhttps://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-metro-and-micro-statistical-areas.html\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nvitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)\nAll legal boundaries and names for Census geography (metropolitan statistical area, county, city, and tract) are as of January 1, 2010, released beginning November 30, 2010, by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Estimates of population density for tracts use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nPopulation estimates for Bay Area PDAs are from the decennial Census (1970 - 2010) and the American Community Survey (2006-2010 5 year rolling average; 2010-2014 5-year rolling average; 2013-2017 5-year rolling average). Population estimates for PDAs are derived from Census population counts at the tract level for 1970-1990 and at the block group level for 2000-2017. Population from either tracts or block groups are allocated to a PDA using an area ratio. For example, if a quarter of a Census block group lies with in a PDA, a quarter of its population will be allocated to that PDA. Tract-to-PDA and block group-to-PDA area ratios are calculated using gross acres. Estimates of population density for PDAs use gross acres as the denominator.\n\nAnnual population estimates for metropolitan areas outside the Bay Area are from the Census and are benchmarked to each decennial Census. The annual estimates in the 1990s were not updated to match the 2000 benchmark.\n\nThe following is a", "attribution": "California Department of Finance", "attribution_link": "http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/", "contact_email": "vitalsigns.info@bayareametro.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-10-16T18:53:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 1, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 1.0}, "columns_name": ["Year", "Pop", "Source", "PopShare", "GeographicArea", "Geography"], "columns_field_name": ["year", "pop", "source", "popshare", "geographicarea", "geography"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Population", "", "Share of the population living in this geographic area", "Indicates the geographical area (Big Three; Bayside; Inland, Coastal and Delta; Unincorporated)", ""], "columns_format": [{"noCommas": "true"}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "download_count": 1, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-10-16T18:54:42.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["demographics", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": ["vital signs"], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.bayareametro.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/d/sufg-ed7z", "link": "https://data.bayareametro.gov/dataset/Vital-Signs-Population-Bay-Area-shares-updated-Oct/sufg-ed7z", "owner": {"id": "wg3i-tdm6", "display_name": "Raleigh McCoy"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Vital Signs: Unemployment Rate \u2013 by metro", "id": "tabg-gyuh", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "VITAL SIGNS INDICATOR\nUnemployment (EC3)\n\nFULL MEASURE NAME\nUnemployment rate by residential location\n\nLAST UPDATED\nJuly 2019\n\nDESCRIPTION\nUnemployment refers to the share of the labor force \u2013 by place of residence \u2013 that is not currently employed full-time or part-time.
