# A new searchable interface for New York Open Data (or any socrata data portal)

Introducing scout, an open source browser-based tool that eases the discovery and curation of thematically related and joinable datasets to broaden the application of open data to uncover new insights.

Scout is designed to help surface datasets in the NYC Open Data Portal that might have escaped your attention before.

## Contributing

We love all contributions, be it a bug report or feature request via a GitHub issue, or feedback over email

## Development

If you want to help with the development of scout, you will need to be able to run the code locally. Scout is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and for development we use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).

To get started install yarn and then run the following in a terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

Once that is done simply run the folowing to start the development server:

```
yarn start
```
