As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP environmental intervention to decrease the prevalence of mice in the home.  The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.\r\nWe can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.  Except for one county, the homes that were selected for a revisit have a lower percentage with mice homes that had an initial visit, indicating an overall reduction in the percentage of homes with mice after the HNP intervention, although mice were not eradicated from all the homes.  Oneida and Cortland Counties show no mice in the revisited homes, which could be an indication of success of the intervention and/or the selection of homes to revisit.  For Westchester County, it is possible that the homes that the revisited homes were the worst and, therefore, had a higher percentage.

survey: \u2022 The BRFSS sampling frame was expanded to include sampling of cell phones \u2022 The weighting methodology was changed from post-stratification to iterative raking. Both changes were piloted and evaluated for three years prior to implementation in 2011, and were found to improve the representativeness of the BRFSS sample. However, these changes in the methodology were found to have a significant impact on rates calculated from BRFSS data. Consequently, BRFSS data prior to 2011 should not be directly compared to data from 2011 forward. As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the BRFSS definition of disability was modified from being based on 2 questions (\u201cAre you limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems?\u201d and \u201cDo you now have any health problem that requires you to use special equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone?\u201d) to 6 questions (\u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d, \u201d Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d, \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?\u201d, \u201dDo you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\u201d, \u201dDo you have difficulty dressing or bathing?\u201d, and \u201dBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping?\u201d).  Data collection for this new definition of disability was initiated on the BRFSS in 2016.  Prior data that was based on the 2-question definition, has been renamed as \u201cLimitation status\u201d, and has been preserved in this table through 2017.

The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS.

Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week\u2019s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.
