The on-street parking bay sensors join to the on-street parking bays by the marker_id attribute.

Usually twice the regular amount of time.\r\n- EffectiveOnPH: Does this restriction apply on public holidays.\r\n- Exemption: Which vehicles are exempt.\r\n\r\nThere can be multiple restrictions, occurring at non-overlapping times.

All of the geometry in the <a href='https://www.sketchup.com/' target='_blank'>SketchUp</a> scene was generated from this spatial data using a custom import routine that was built in ruby to make the most of SketchUp\u2019s API. This process ensures that all of the data in the scene is clean and optimised for use in SketchUp. These optimisations involved all of the separate spatial layers being imported as discreet SketchUp scene layers and all building objects being appropriately grouped to ensure solid geometry integrity.\n\nThis simplified 3D model of the City of Melbourne was generated using a range of spatial layers already available from the Open Data portal including:\n\u2022\tBuilding Roof Prints\n\u2022\tDevelopment Activity\n\u2022\tProperty Base Layer\n\u2022\tStreet Segments\n\nThe final scene is georeferenced using SketchUp\u2019s native world coordinate system with the origin of the scene relating to X,Y in Map Grid of Australia coordinates (MGA94 Zone 55) or Lat,Lon in geographic coordinates (WGS84). The scene\u2019s unit system is provided in metres.\n\nNo terrain or elevation model has been provided in the scene and as such there is no relation with any real-world height datum (i.e. the Australian Height Datum). The height of the buildings in the scene are generated from the input data which is given as the height of the building in the real-world, taken from the level of the ground at the base of the building to the top of the structure. The base of all buildings in the SketchUp scene is located at 0.0 metres in height which means that the relative heights between building objects in the scene are not accurate to in relation their real-world counterparts.\n\nLimitations:\nThis simplified model of Melbourne City is intended for use in non-analytical, conceptual or hobbyist pursuits. This model is provided with the following caveats:\n- The model is derived from a range of sources at various times and as such the content may not be free from errors, omissions or defects.
