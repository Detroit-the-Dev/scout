For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates vendors that currently have filing requirements with DOR, as well as valid exemption and wholesaler certificates.\r\nThis list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved.  The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided.  The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items.\r\nSales, use and hotel occupancy tax licenses must be prominently displayed at the place of business, at each location, photocopies are acceptable.  This list also contains exempt organizations that have a current valid exemption number issued by the Department.  Exemption numbers must be provided on exemption certificates when purchasing items or services that would be otherwise taxable. \r\nFor the taxpayer\u2019s convenience, the Department of Revenue allows taxpayers to either report each location\u2019s sales under a unique license number, or consolidate the entire entity\u2019s sales under a single license number.  For that reason, you may see some large chains appear to have only one license, where others have multiple licenses.  Similarly, you will find licenses/certificates with out of state addresses provided by the applicant.\r\nIn order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number / exemption certificate number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling taxable items, providing a taxable service or otherwise not remitting sales tax, use this link to Report Tax Fraud.  Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful.\r\nMore information about licenses & certificates: PA Code, Article II Sales & Use Tax.\r\nPA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov.  \r\nCommon questions:\r\n\u2022\tWhy are there out of state/out of country licenses?  We allow taxpayers to photocopy licenses, so taxpayers could keep the original license where their records are kept, and post a copy in each PA location.  Another reason would be mail order or delivery-based companies.  These companies do not maintain a PA address, but could ship to PA or travel into PA to deliver their taxable product or perform their taxable service. \r\n\u2022\tDoes this list contain every volunteer fire company in PA?  Only if the volunteer fire company applied for an exemption certificate to purchase items without paying sales tax.  An exempt entity that does not hold an exemption certificate could pay the sales tax on the purchase, then file a petition for refund on the tax paid.\r\n\u2022\tWhat is a \u201ctransient vendor\u201d?  In general, someone who temporarily brings taxable items into PA for retail sale, but does not maintain a location.  For a more detailed definition, see the PA Code link above.\r\n\u2022\tWhat is a \u201cwholesaler certificate\u201d?  A wholesale certificate allows sales of otherwise taxable items at the wholesale level; they are not permitted to sell anything at retail.  The tax will be collected when the item is sold at retail.

If a driver or pedestrian is suspected and were tested, but the test results show no drugs, this situation would not be included.\n\nDRUGGED_DRIVER \tAt least one Driver with Drugs reported or suspected \tNUMBER \nThis flag is similar to drug_related, but it only applies to drivers.  It defines whether the crash involved a driver suspected of using drugs or was actually tested and had drugs in their system.  If a driver is suspected and were tested, but the test results show no drugs, this situation would not be included.\n\nILLEGAL_DRUG_RELATED \tAt Least 1 Driver or Pedestrian had reported or suspected Illegal Drug Use \tNUMBER \nThis flag is similar to drug_related, but it only applies to illegal drugs.  It defines whether the crash involved a driver or pedestrian suspected of using illegal drugs.  If a driver is suspected and were tested, but the test results show no drugs, this situation would not be included.\n\nIMPAIRED_DRIVER \tAt least One Driver was Impaired by Drugs or Alcohol \tNUMBER \nThis flag is similar to drug_related, but it includes both alcohol and drugs and it only applies to drivers.  It defines whether the crash involved a driver suspected of using drugs or alcohol or was actually tested and had drugs or alcohol in their system.  If a driver is suspected and were tested, but the test results show no drugs, this situation would not be included.\n* For additional information please review the Crash Data Information pdf

of tobacco products tax licenses as maintained by the Department of Revenue (DOR) that are currently active.  For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates dealers authorized to handle tobacco products subject to Pennsylvania tax.\r\nThis list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved.  The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided.  The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items.\r\nTobacco products licenses must be conspicuously displayed at the location issued.\r\nIn order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling unstamped cigarettes, or selling tobacco products without a license in Pennsylvania, use this link to Report Tax Fraud.  Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful.\r\nMore information about the tobacco products tax: PA Code, Article III Cigarette and Beverage Taxes.\r\nPA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov.  \r\nCommon questions:\r\n\u2022\tWhy are there out of state/out of country licenses?  Tobacco products tax requires licensing at all levels before shipping to PA wholesalers and retailers.  Some stampers, manufacturers or wholesalers maintain product outside PA and ship to PA retailers or wholesalers.  The license should be the location the product is stored. \r\n\u2022\tWhat is \u201cOther Tobacco Products\u201d (OTP)? The cigarette tax law was amended in 2016 to include electronic cigarettes and related liquid (commonly referred to as vaping), roll-your-own tobacco (loose tobacco that can be used to make cigarettes), snuff, pipe tobacco, and other tobacco products used for chewing, ingesting or smoking.  More information is available from Revenue\u2019s web site.\r\n\u2022\tDoes this list contain every tobacco product retailer?  It should.  In order to sell product legally in PA, a retailer must be licensed.

SAHIE is only source of single-year health insurance coverage estimates for all U.S. counties.\r\n\r\nFor 2008-2014, SAHIE publishes STATE and COUNTY estimates of population with and without health insurance coverage, along with measures of uncertainty, for the full cross-classification of:\r\n\u20225 age categories: 0-64, 18-64, 21-64, 40-64, and 50-64\r\n\r\n\u20223 sex categories: both sexes, male, and female\r\n\r\n\u20226 income categories: all incomes, as well as income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories 0-138%, 0-200%, 0-250%, 0-400%, and 138-400% of the poverty threshold\r\n\r\n\u20224 races/ethnicities (for states only): all races/ethnicities, White not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, and Hispanic (any race).\r\n\r\nIn addition, estimates for age category 0-18 by the income categories listed above are published.\r\n\r\nEach year\u2019s estimates are adjusted so that, before rounding, the county estimates sum to their respective state totals and for key demographics the state estimates sum to the national ACS numbers insured and uninsured.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC), National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection ProgramLink to a non-federal Web site (NBCCEDP). The CDC have a congressional mandate to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer to low-income, uninsured, and underserved women through the NBCCEDP. Most state NBCCEDP programs define low-income as 200 or 250 percent of the poverty threshold. Also included are IPR categories relevant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2014, the ACA will help families gain access to health care by allowing Medicaid to cover families with incomes less than or equal to 138 percent of the poverty line. Families with incomes above the level needed to qualify for Medicaid, but less than or equal to 400 percent of the poverty line can receive tax credits that will help them pay for health coverage in the new health insurance exchanges. \r\n\r\nWe welcome your feedback as we continue to research and improve our estimation methods. The SAHIE program's age model methodology and estimates have undergone internal U.S. Census Bureau review as well as external review. See the SAHIE Methodological Review page for more details and a summary of the comments and our response. \r\n\r\nThe SAHIE program models health insurance coverage by combining survey data from several sources, including:\r\n\u2022The American Community Survey (ACS)\r\n\u2022Demographic population estimates\r\n\u2022Aggregated federal tax returns\r\n\u2022Participation records for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp program\r\n\u2022County Business Patterns\r\n\u2022Medicaid\r\n\u2022Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) participation records\r\n\u2022Census 2010\r\n\r\nMargin of error (MOE). Some ACS products provide\r\nan MOE instead of confidence intervals. An MOE is the\r\ndifference between an estimate and its upper or lower\r\nconfidence bounds. Confidence bounds can be created\r\nby adding the margin of error to the estimate (for the\r\nupper bound) and subtracting the margin of error from\r\nthe estimate (for the lower bound). All published ACS\r\nmargins of error are based on a 90-percent confidence\r\nlevel.", "attribution": "Small Area Health Insurance Estimates Program, U.S. Census Bureau", "attribution_link":

The 1997 OMB standards permit the reporting of more than one race. An individual\u2019s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. An individual\u2019s response to the race question is based upon self-identification. The Census Bureau does not tell individuals which boxes to mark or what heritage to write in. For the first time in Census 2000, individuals were presented with the option to self-identify with more than one race and this continued with the 2010 Census. People who identify with more than one race may choose to provide multiple races in response to the race question. For example, if a respondent identifies as \"Asian\" and \"White,\" they may respond to the question on race by checking the appropriate boxes that describe their racial identities and/or writing in these identities on the spaces provided. What is Race? The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of individuals in the United States. The Census Bureau collects racial data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cWhite.\u201d People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. OMB requires five minimum categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Reasons for collecting information on race Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights.

Centers of Excellence (COEs) were grant funded by the Department of Human Services, PacMATs were grant funded by the Department of Health, and all other facilities are funded by either billing insurance or billing the county in the case of uninsured clients. \n \nProgrammatically, COEs differ from the other types because they are designed to serve as \u201chealth homes\u201d for individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). This means that the care coordination staff at the COE is charged with coordinating all kinds of health care (physical and behavioral health) as well as recovery support services. They do this by developing hub-and-spoke networks with other healthcare providers and other sources for recovery supports, such as housing, transportation, education and training, etc. All COEs are required to accept Medicaid.\n \nPacMATs also operate in a hub-and-spoke model, but it is different from COEs. PacMATs endeavor to coordinate the provision of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) by identifying a core hub of physicians in a health system that work with other providers in the health system (spokes) to train them about the safe and effective provision of MAT so that there are more providers in a health system that are able to confidently prescribe various forms of MAT. I do not know whether all PacMATs are required to accept Medicaid as a term of their receipt of the grant, but I do know that all currently designated PacMATs are health systems that do accept Medicaid. PacMAT services have been advertised as being available to all people regardless of insurance type, so I assume this means they are required to serve Medicaid clients, commercially insured clients, and uninsured clients. In the PacMAT program the Hub is supported right now by grant funding (in the future funding such as a per patient/per month capitated rate) and the spokes bill insurance (both Medicaid and Commercial)  \n \nDDAP facilities may also be designated as COEs and/or PacMATs. If they are, it means they applied for a specific grant fund and have committed to carrying out the activities of the grant described above. To be clear, DDAP does not run any treatment facilities; they license them. These can be MAT providers such as methadone clinics, providers of outpatient levels of care (i.e., more traditional drug and alcohol counseling services) or inpatient levels of care, such as residential rehabilitation programs. Every facility is different in terms of the menu of services it provides.  Every facility also gets to decide what forms of payment they will accept. Many accept Medicaid, but not all do. Some only accept private commercial insurance. Some accept payment from the county on behalf of uninsured clients. And some charge their clients cash for services.", "attribution": "Departments of Health, Human Services and Drug and Alcohol", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "Open_data_questions@pa.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-04-16T21:24:21.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-06-07T19:33:37.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-04-16T21:24:21.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-06-11T17:33:47.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 1, "page_views_last_month": 4, "page_views_total": 727, "page_views_last_week_log": 1.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 2.321928094887362, "page_views_total_log": 9.507794640198696}, "columns_name": ["Location 1 (zip)", "Location 1 (city)", "Location 1 (address)", "Location 1", "County Code", "County Number", "County FIPS code", "State FIPS code", "Phone number", "Street address", "Pennsylvania County Boundaries", "Pa Senatorial Districts (2017-01)", "Pa House Districts (2017-01)", "Pa School Districts (2017)", "Municipality Boundary", "Location 1 (state)", "Name of Facility", "Type of Facility", "County"], "columns_field_name": ["location_1_zip", "location_1_city", "location_1_address", "location_1", "county_code", "county_number", "county_fips_code", "state_fips_code", "phone_number", "street_address", ":@computed_region_nmsq_hqvv", ":@computed_region_d3gw_znnf", ":@computed_region_r6rf_p9et", ":@computed_region_rayf_jjgk", ":@computed_region_amqz_jbr4", "location_1_state", "name_of_facility", "type_of_facility", "county"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "", "", "Provides Latitude and Longitude of a point where the Facility is located to be used for visualizations such as a geographical map.

Cases are usually identified because they have finally become symptomatic, or they were screened.  Until very recently, screening for hepatitis C was not routinely performed.  This makes it very challenging to identify persons with recent infection.  Limiting the age of newly identified patients to 15-34 years makes it more likely that the cases included in the dashboard were infected fairly recently.  It is not meant to imply that the opioid crisis\u2019 effect on hepatitis C transmission is limited to younger people.  \r\nThe process by which case counts are determined is as follows:  Case reports, which include lab test results and address data, are sent to Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic disease surveillance system (PA-NEDSS).  Confirmation status is determined by public health investigators who evaluate test results against the CDC case definition for hepatitis C in place for the year in which the patient was first reported (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-c-chronic/).  Reportable disease data, including hepatitis C, is extracted from PA-NEDSS, combined with similar data sent by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH, which uses a separate surveillance system), and sent to CDC.  Case data sent to CDC (from PA-NEDSS and PDPH combined) are used to create a statewide reportable disease dataset.  This statewide file was used to generate the dashboard dataset.    \r\nNote that the term that CDC has used to denote persons with hepatitis C infection that is not known to be acute has switched back and forth between \u201cHepatitis C, past or present\u201d and \u201cHepatitis C, chronic\u201d over the past several years.  The CDC case definition for hepatitis C, chronic (or past or present) changed in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016.  Persons reported as confirmed in one year may not have been considered confirmed in another year.  For example, patients with a positive radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) or elevated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) signal-to-cutoff level were counted as confirmed in 2012, but not counted as confirmed in 2016.  \r\nData sent to CDC\u2019s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System use a measure for aggregating cases by year called the MMWR year.  The MMWR, or the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is an official publication by CDC and the means by which CDC has historically presented aggregated case count data.  Since data in the MMWR are presented by week, the MMWR year always starts on the Sunday closest to Jan 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to Dec 31.  The most recent year for which case counts are finalized is 2016.  Annual case counts are finalized in May of the following year.  \r\nThe patient zip code, as submitted to PA-NEDSS, is used to determine the case\u2019s county of residence at the time of initial case report.  In some instances, the patient zip code is unavailable.  In those circumstances, the zip code of the provider that ordered the lab test is used as a proxy for patient zip code.    \r\nUsers should note that the state prison system routinely screens all incoming inmates for hepatitis C.  If these inmates are determined to be confirmed cases, they are assigned to the county in which they were incarcerated when their confirmed hepatitis C was first identified.  Hepatitis C case counts in counties with state prisons should be interpreted cautiously in light of this enhanced screening activity.", "attribution": "Department of Health", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "RA-DHPRESSOFFICE@pa.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2018-09-20T14:30:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-16T18:41:12.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-09-20T14:30:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2018-06-05T13:13:41.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 10, "page_views_total": 344, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 3.4594316186372978, "page_views_total_log": 8.430452551665532}, "columns_name": ["Latitude/Longitude (city)", "Hepatitis C counts", "Year", "Pa Senatorial Districts (2017-01)", "Pennsylvania County Boundaries", "Pa House Districts (2017-01)", "Pa School Districts (2017)", "Municipality Boundary", "Latitude/Longitude (state)", "Latitude/Longitude (zip)", "Latitude/Longitude (address)", "State FIPS Code", "Hepatitis Count Description", "County Name", "County Code Number", "County FIPS Code", "Latitude/Longitude", "County Code"], "columns_field_name": ["location_1_city", "hcvcounts", "year", ":@computed_region_d3gw_znnf", ":@computed_region_nmsq_hqvv", ":@computed_region_r6rf_p9et", ":@computed_region_rayf_jjgk", ":@computed_region_amqz_jbr4", "location_1_state", "location_1_zip", "location_1_address", "state_fips_code", "hepatitis_count_description", "county_name", "county_code_number", "county_fips_code", "location_1", "county_code"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Text", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Number", "Text", "Point", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "Number of newly identified confirmed cases of hepatitis C (past or present, or chronic) in persons aged 15-34 in the specified county and year.

The Data Center would not be possible without the trust of our partners and support from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, The Heinz Endowments, and the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe University Center has long served as a community information intermediary in Allegheny County. Information intermediaries help people find and use information to improve their communities. The Data Center is one in a long line of initiatives of the University Center in this intermediary role. From 2005-2014, the Center operated the Pittsburgh Neighborhood and Community Information System, is home to the Pittsburgh Today regional indicators initiative, and recently launched the Southwestern Pennsylvania Community Profiles community indicators project.\n\nOver time, the University Center realized that the broader use of data in the region was inhibited by the lack of a legal infrastructure, technologies that did not support the dissemination of raw data, incomplete data documentation, and a lack of capacity for managing information in a fragmented political environment. The Data Center provides this infrastructure while institutionalizing the role of a data intermediary within a regional open data infrastructure. In 2013 and 2014, we wrote about our early open data experiences in a two part series (part one,  part two).\n\nWe are often asked by people in other cities to talk more about the Regional Data Center.

The number prefixes are part of the chemical name describing the isomer ( ions or molecules with identical formulas but distinct structures ) part of the name.  For example - 1,2,3,4,5,6 refer to the positions on the cyclohexane molecule where a chlorine atom is substituted for a hydrogen.  The carbon atoms on the cyclohexane ring can be numbered 1 through 6.  Due to the symmetry of this particular molecule, it doesn\u2019t really matter where we start counting on the ring.  What does matter is that each number is only mentioned once, which means there is only 1 chlorine atom attached to each carbon.  One can envision other forms of Hexachlorocyclohexane in which multiple chlorines are attached to a single carbon atom.  For example: 1,1,2,2,3,3 Hexachlorocyclohexane would have two chlorine atoms attached to each of 3 sequential carbon atoms, with none on the other three\u2026  Now 1,2,3,4,5,6 Hexachlorocyclohexane can refer to a mixture of isomers of that molecule.  This is because the ring of cyclohexane\u2019s carbon atoms locks the attached hydrogens and chlorines onto one side of the ring, and this naming convention is not specific enough to tell which chlorine atoms are locked \u201cabove\u201d the ring and which are \u201cbelow it\u201d.  So in order to know which specific isomer we are talked about, a more specific name is required.  This is where the other numbers can help.  \u201c58-89-9\u201d is the  Chemical Abstracts Service (registration) number, sometimes abbreviated CAS # or CASRN.  This is really not part of the name of the molecule, but rather a unique serial number assigned to the molecule.  The number itself is pretty much arbitrarily assigned by the American Chemical Society, but it is important in that it is unique, like a bar code for the molecule.  The number is typically written in 3 parts separated by dashes, with two to seven digits in the first part, two in the second, and one in the third.  If we google CAS#58-89-9  we find out that we are working with the \u201cgamma\u201d isomer of 1,2,3,4,5,6 Hexachlorocyclohexane where the chlorines are arranged around the ring in an up-up-down-up-up-down configuration.

add value to the process. This approach is based on a set of principles which focuses on customer and encourages a workplace culture of employee engagement and respect for those who do the work. It\u2019s about developing a mindset of continuous improvement and leveraging the knowledge of front-line staff, our subject matter experts, to identify incremental improvements that add up over time.\r\nGovernor Wolf is seeking to streamline state services to make them easier, better, and faster to the benefit of the citizens of PA through adopting a Lean culture in PA agencies. The goal is to increase efficiency, remove waste, and to rethink how we do business to improve state services and better meet the needs of our diverse customer base.\r\nWhile Lean found its roots in a manufacturing environment, specifically through the Toyota Production System (TPS), the concepts and tools and have been successfully applied across all industries. Having previously implemented Lean in his private business, Governor Wolf is currently working with commonwealth agencies to embrace Lean at an enterprise level and ensure front line employees have a voice to challenge the old way of doing business.\u201d", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "", "type": "measure", "updatedAt": "2019-09-09T21:03:34.000Z", "createdAt": "2019-06-28T20:36:04.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-09-09T21:03:34.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-06-28T20:36:04.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 0, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 0.0}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": null, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "measure", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-09-09T21:03:33.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["finance", "environment"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Government That Works", "domain_tags": ["efficiency", "lean", "goal", "governor"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Data-Management_Update-Frequency", "value": "Monthly"}, {"key": "Data-Management_Business-Owner", "value": "Office of Administration (OA)"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.pa.gov", "license": "Public Domain U.S. Government"}, "permalink": "https://data.pa.gov/d/a6h8-riyz", "link": "https://data.pa.gov/Government-That-Works/Employees-Engaged-in-Lean-Awareness/a6h8-riyz", "owner": {"id": "gepk-v9gc", "display_name": "Colby Clabaugh"}}, {"resource": {"name": "2020 Primary Mail Ballots Returned %", "id": "m5hb-icht", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This is a percentage of ballots returned by approved applications for the 2020 primary election.", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "measure", "updatedAt": "2020-06-05T17:23:08.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-28T14:05:21.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-06-05T17:23:08.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-05-28T14:05:21.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 0, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 0.0}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": 0, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "measure", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-06-05T17:23:08.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["politics"], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.pa.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.pa.gov/d/m5hb-icht", "link": "https://data.pa.gov/dataset/2020-Primary-Mail-Ballots-Returned-/m5hb-icht", "owner": {"id": "d49s-6nbx", "display_name": "Mike Moser"}}, {"resource": {"name": "2020 Linked Voter Count", "id": "hfh6-hn7x", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "", "attribution": null, "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "measure", "updatedAt": "2020-05-28T12:59:19.000Z", "createdAt": "2020-05-01T16:29:35.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2020-05-28T12:59:19.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-05-01T16:29:35.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 0, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 0.0}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": 0, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "measure", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2020-05-28T12:59:19.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": [], "tags": [], "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.pa.gov"}, "permalink": "https://data.pa.gov/d/hfh6-hn7x", "link": "https://data.pa.gov/dataset/2020-Linked-Voter-Count/hfh6-hn7x", "owner": {"id": "d49s-6nbx", "display_name": "Mike Moser"}}]
