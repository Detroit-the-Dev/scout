Income for the City of Mesa, and some comparative numbers from other neighboring communities as well as Maricopa County.\r\nCensus money income is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. \r\nTherefore, money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health benefits, subsidized housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm. In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. \r\n\r\nData users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. \r\nCensus also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity. \r\nThese alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\r\n\r\nWhat does Income Include? http://www.census.gov/cps/data/incdef.html", "attribution": "Economic Development", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "xEconomicDevelopmentData@MesaAZ.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2019-02-11T20:21:44.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-03-21T20:31:41.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2019-02-11T20:21:44.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-11T20:21:38.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 4, "page_views_last_month": 12, "page_views_total": 204, "page_views_last_week_log": 2.321928094887362, "page_views_last_month_log": 3.700439718141092, "page_views_total_log": 7.679480099505446}, "columns_name": ["Amount", "Aggregate", "Year", "Community"], "columns_field_name": ["amount", "aggregate", "year", "community"], "columns_datatype": ["Number", "Text", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["Value reported for Annual Income", "Median household income or Per capita household income", "Reporting Year", "City or County"], "columns_format": [{"precision": "0", "align": "left", "currencyStyle": "USD", "humane": "false", "precisionStyle": "currency"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}, {"precisionStyle": "standard", "noCommas": "true", "align": "right"}, {"displayStyle": "plain", "align": "left"}], "download_count": 31, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2019-02-11T20:21:44.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "finance", "transportation"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Neighborhoods", "domain_tags": ["per capita", "household", "mesa"], "domain_metadata": [{"key": "Terms-of-Use_Terms-of-Use", "value": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/stories/s/2dcd-j2nx/"}, {"key": "Frequency_Publishing", "value": "yearly"}, {"key": "Frequency_Data-Change", "value": "yearly"}]}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.mesaaz.gov", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/d/vagb-mau5", "link": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/Neighborhoods/Annual-Income-Median-and-Per-Capita/vagb-mau5", "owner": {"id": "pxyu-mdaq", "display_name": "City of Mesa"}}, {"resource": {"name": "CIP Project Details", "id": "q6d9-b6h2", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "CIP Project Details used by Capital Budget Summary within Open Budget module.", "attribution": "Office of Management and Budget", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": "xOfficeOfManagementAndBudgetData@MesaAZ.gov", "type": "dataset", "updatedAt": "2020-05-16T05:01:19.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-02-15T00:35:37.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-05-31T17:46:27.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2020-05-16T05:01:19.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 2, "page_views_last_month": 10, "page_views_total": 198, "page_views_last_week_log": 1.5849625007211563, "page_views_last_month_log": 3.4594316186372978, "page_views_total_log": 7.636624620543649}, "columns_name": ["Location (zip)", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Region", "Major Progam Name", "Major Program", "Location (state)", "Location (city)", "Location (address)", "Location", "Mesa Census Tracts To City Boundary", "Project Description"], "columns_field_name": ["location_zip", "latitude", "longitude", "region", "major_progam_name", "major_program", "location_state", "location_city", "location_address", "location", ":@computed_region_fcpr_wj2n", "project_description"], "columns_datatype": ["Text", "Number", "Number", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Text", "Point", "Number", "Text"], "columns_description": ["", "The latitudinal location related to a specific project.", "The longitudinal location related to a specific project.", "The council district location of a specific project.

Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9. Sales tax revenue includes Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) and Transient Lodging Tax (TLT).

In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. <br /><br />Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. <br />Census also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity. <br />These alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).<br /><br />What does Income Include? <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/cps/data/incdef.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external\">http://www.census.gov/cps/data/incdef.html</a>", "attribution": "Economic Development", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "chart", "updatedAt": "2019-02-11T20:21:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-03-21T21:24:02.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-10-15T16:57:20.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-11T20:21:38.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 2, "page_views_total": 129, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 1.5849625007211563, "page_views_total_log": 7.022367813028454}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": 2, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-03-21T21:24:02.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["health", "transportation", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Neighborhoods", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.mesaaz.gov", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/d/vayr-du86", "link": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/Neighborhoods/Per-Capita-Income-of-Mesa-and-Surrounding-Communit/vayr-du86", "owner": {"id": "kx4r-c8r6", "display_name": "Jenn Fisher"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Streetlight Fixtures", "id": "dm4g-y5j4", "parent_fxf": [], "description": "This feature class identifies all streetlight fixtures within the boundary of the City of Mesa, including portions of other bordering agencies.

taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see \"Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month\" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9. Sales tax revenue includes Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) and Transient Lodging Tax (TLT). Effective January 2017, the Arizona Department of Revenue administers sales and use tax collection for all state, county and municipal taxing jurisdictions.

Location information is summarized to the 100-block level and is not an exact location where the clean up event took place.

In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. \n\nData users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. \nCensus also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity. \nThese alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nWhat does Income Include?

In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. <br /><br />Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. <br />Census also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity. <br />These alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).<br /><br />What does Income Include? <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/cps/data/incdef.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external\">http://www.census.gov/cps/data/incdef.html</a>", "attribution": "Economic Development", "attribution_link": null, "contact_email": null, "type": "chart", "updatedAt": "2019-02-11T20:21:38.000Z", "createdAt": "2018-03-21T21:22:00.000Z", "metadata_updated_at": "2018-04-10T01:05:22.000Z", "data_updated_at": "2019-02-11T20:21:38.000Z", "page_views": {"page_views_last_week": 0, "page_views_last_month": 0, "page_views_total": 58, "page_views_last_week_log": 0.0, "page_views_last_month_log": 0.0, "page_views_total_log": 5.882643049361842}, "columns_name": [], "columns_field_name": [], "columns_datatype": [], "columns_description": [], "columns_format": [], "download_count": 1, "provenance": "official", "lens_view_type": "tabular", "blob_mime_type": null, "hide_from_data_json": false, "publication_date": "2018-03-21T21:22:00.000Z"}, "classification": {"categories": ["transportation", "health", "finance"], "tags": [], "domain_category": "Neighborhoods", "domain_tags": [], "domain_metadata": []}, "metadata": {"domain": "data.mesaaz.gov", "license": "See Terms of Use"}, "permalink": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/d/skv5-pcce", "link": "https://data.mesaaz.gov/Neighborhoods/Median-Household-Income-of-Mesa-and-Surrounding-Co/skv5-pcce", "owner": {"id": "kx4r-c8r6", "display_name": "Jenn Fisher"}}, {"resource": {"name": "Average Homeowner's Annual Cost Comparison - by Fiscal Year", "id": "gaz5-p9yg", "parent_fxf": ["annh-6khi"], "description": "Comparison of the average costs incurred by homeowners in several cities throughout the Valley.

Posting month is the accounting period the City booked the revenues and is used for financial reporting and budgeting purposes. To see a map of downtown Mesa boundaries see the \"Source Link\" in the 'About this Dataset' section below. Because of taxpayer confidentiality guidelines, a category or business class with fewer than 10 taxpayers is combined with a similar taxpayer category. If after combining there are still less than 10 taxpayers then the category is excluded and associated revenues are posted as \"Other\". Transient Lodging Tax (TLT) revenues are NOT included in this dataset because there are too few taxpayers in the downtown area to report. For sales tax revenues reflecting consumer activity periods (period when the taxes where collected by businesses), see \"Downtown Tax Revenue by Report Month\" at <a href=\"https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Downtown-Tax-Revenue-by-Report-Month/258t-7i6w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external\">https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Downtown-Tax-Revenue-by-Report-Month/258t-7i6w</a>.
